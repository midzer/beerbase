A truly delicious beer, Heffevenom is a medium bodied, lightly hopped wheat beer brewed in the true Bavarian tradition.  Our brewers combine mountain pure water, select wheat and domestic malted grain, hops and yeast to create a highly refreshing ale with a pronounced banana and clove bouquet. Perfect with a slice of lemon as garnish.
