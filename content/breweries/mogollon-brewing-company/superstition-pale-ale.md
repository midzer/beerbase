If you are searching for a light, refreshing pale ale, your search is over!  Superstition Pale Ale is named after the Superstition Mountains which are just east of Phoenix.  This American pale ale is brewed using mountain pure water, select domestic grain, yeast and hops from the Pacific Northwest.  Superstition is copper in color with a clean, malty fullness and finishes with pronounced hop bitterness.  Perfect for enjoying on a warm Arizona day.
