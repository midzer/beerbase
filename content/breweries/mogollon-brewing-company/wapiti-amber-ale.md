This is our flagship ale.  The label for this beer is adorned with the majestic Wapiti (aka elk).  Wapiti are abundant in northern Arizona.  They are large and beautiful creatures, which is why we chose this animal to represent this beer.  Wapiti Amber Ale is hand crafted with mountain pure water, two row malted barley, yeast and Yakima Valley hops.  Our brewers use traditional methods to create this full-bodied amber ale with a distinct hoppy aroma.  Wapiti Amber Ale should be enjoyed cool, not cold, to best experience the complex character and flowery aroma.  Serve at 43-47 deg F.
