Mogollon Brewing Company, LLC, and High Spirits Distillery is a small, 20 bbl micro brewery and distillery. Our beers and spirits are hand crafted from the finest ingredients available and we use pure mountain water.  The artwork found on our labels is the embodiment of, and is inspired by, Northern Arizona wildlife.  Mogollon Brewing takes its name from the Mogollon Plateau which sits at 7000 feet above sea level.   We are now located at 4366 Huntington Drive in Flagstaff, AZ.  This is a brand new 4500 square foot building designed and built specifically for brewing beer and distilling spirits.
