This Belgian style pumpkin ale was inspired by the legendary midnight ride of Ichabod Crane. It is a Belgian style ale complimented by a light touch of pumpkin and spice. Fresh toasted pumpkins are added in the mash with the grains adding a touch of the season to the brew. The complex fruitiness and dryness of the yeast is enhanced by the addition of sugars during fermantation. The beer is lightly spiced with pumpkin spice, all spice, and brown sugar. The pale and toasted malts used, provide a pie crust taste and smell in the beer as the higher alcohol's produced round out the finish.
