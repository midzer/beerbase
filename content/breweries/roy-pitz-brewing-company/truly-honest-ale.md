Our signature brew that started it all. This beer is made with four different specialty malts including two foreign caramel malts, a pale malt, and a toasted malt. These malts impart a subtle toasted/sweet taste. This malty brew is than graced with floral and aroma hops which balance the maltiness of this brew and leaves behind a smooth finish on the palate. Top notch ingredients and a truly Honest" taste makes this a seriously drinkable ale
