This brew was inspired by the historical burning of our hometown of Chambersburg, PA in July 1864. During the burning, the brewery in town, Ludwigs Brewery" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier
