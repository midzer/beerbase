Dominion Oak Barrel Stout raises the bar for American stouts. We use smoked and peated malts to create an intricate malt foundation.  Willamette and Cascade hops balance the malt character and our method of dry hopping with vanilla beans and oak chips pushes the depth of our stout's flavor spectrum even further.
