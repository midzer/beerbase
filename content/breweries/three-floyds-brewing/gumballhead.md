Three Floyds official summer beer highly dry hopped American wheat beer. Quite hoppy. Gumballhead is brewed from red wheat and amarillo hops. It has a medium haze, due to bottle conditioning; once the beer is bottled, extra yeast is added for a secondary fermentation. The hops give off a pronounced citrus note on the nose. Notes of bread - from the yeast - and a good malt undertone. Medium carbonation.
