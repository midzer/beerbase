(512) ALT is a German-style amber ale that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager. ALT means “old” in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone and a characteristic German yeast character. Made with 98% Organic 2-row and Munch malts and US noble hops.
