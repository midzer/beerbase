Our first anniversary release is a Belgian-style strong ale that is amber in color, with a light to medium body. Subtle malt sweetness is balanced with noticeable hop flavor, light raisin and mildly spicy, cake-like flavors, and is finished with local wildflower honey aromas. Made with 80% Organic Malted Barley, Belgian Specialty grains, Forbidden Fruit yeast, domestic hops and Round Rock local wildflower honey, this beer is deceptively high in alcohol.
