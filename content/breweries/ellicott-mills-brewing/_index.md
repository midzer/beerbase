Here at the Mills we have a very simple, yet demanding approach to producing Alpenhof beer. We use the very best ingredients available. We are efficient and precise in production method, yet we allow the product to age to its full maturity. Balance is the key to our beer.  Alpenhof beer is not created to challenge the senses. It is not created to be a complex beer. Well balanced for Alpenhof means smooth and easy-drinking. The way a beer should taste.  To achieve this well balanced taste, only the finest ingredients are used. We import our malt, hops, and yeast from Germany. (For true German style Lager beer, authentic ingredients are essential!) We might spend more for our ingredients, but it is well worth it. This is an expense you can actually taste!
