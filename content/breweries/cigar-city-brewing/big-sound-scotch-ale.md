Big Sound Scotch Ale is dedicated to our good buddy Gino, the most punk rock bagpiper you'll ever meet, and the rest of the men and women of Tampa Bay Pipes and Drums. Brown in color, Big Sound has huge notes of dark sweet toffee with underlying mild notes of coffee in the aroma. The flavor starts with a slight note of cherry and then opens into a Goliath of a malt character with notes of dark sweet toffee, slight hints of coffee and mild notes of toasted bread in the finish. Big Sound Scotch Ale pairs well with Haggis, Highland Games, Huge Heads and Enormous Pillows and of course Bagpipe music.
