This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Gregory Zhukov. Arguably one of World War II's finest generals and a man bold enough to appreciate the rich, complex flavors of a beer brewed to fortify a body through the Russian winter. Like military geniuses, Russian Imperial Stouts reach their peak with a little age on them, so we release Marshal Zhukov's Russian Imperial Stout in sweltering August so that it will be at peak flavor come January or February.

Opaque black in color, the aroma has notes of espresso, chocolate, dark sweet toffee with hints of black strap molasses. The flavor starts with an unsweetened chocolate character and supporting notes of herbal dryness from English hop varietals. It then moves into dark toffee sweetness and closes with a slap of roasty espresso. Zhukov's Imperial Stout pairs well with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.  Enjoy, comrade.
