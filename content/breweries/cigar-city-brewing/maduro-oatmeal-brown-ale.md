Maduro is a Northern English-style brown ale with some American affectations. It is unlike the typical American Brown Ale, as it doesnâ€™t have the big hop character common in American-brewed Brown Ales. And Maduro is higher in alcohol than the common English brown ale. Maduro also has oats, in the malt bill which imparts a silky body and aids in making the roasted, toasted and chocolate components mesh together in Maduro's complex malt profile. The end result is a remarkably full flavored yet approachable and sessionable brown ale that pairs well with cigars.
