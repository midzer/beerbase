A complex beer, with layers of flavors unfolding as this beer slides down your throat. Before the introduction of indirect-fired malt kilns, all beers had a smoky flavor. Today only a handful of brewers produce beer reminiscent of those of the past. We use imported German smoked malt to add depth and complexity to our Smoked Porter.
