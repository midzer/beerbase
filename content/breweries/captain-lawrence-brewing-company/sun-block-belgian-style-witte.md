This beer was created as a summer thirst quencher, because we all know how hot and humid it can get in New York during the summer. We brewed this beer using both coriander and orange peel in the boil to increase both the aroma and flavor of this beer. Make sure you donâ€™t get burned this summer, drink your Sun Block.
