One of the first beers I brewed after moving out to California to begin my brewing education was a Pale Ale. This version is a true testament to the influences the Wild West had on my early brewing. My Pale Ale is loaded with US-grown Cascade, Crystal, and Columbus hops, so be sure to take a good sniff to enjoy their robust aromas before taking your first sip.
