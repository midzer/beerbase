Thereâ€™s nothing quite likes Momâ€™s apple pieâ€¦But I am willing to bet this beer is pretty darn close.  An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this countryâ€™s oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captainâ€™s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.
