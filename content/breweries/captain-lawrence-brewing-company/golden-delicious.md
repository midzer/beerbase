There’s nothing quite likes Mom’s apple pie…But I am willing to bet this beer is pretty darn close.  An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this country’s oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captain’s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy.
