Paulaner Salvator, with its strong, typically malty flavour, is what you could call the \original\" Paulaner. The bottom-fermented \"Doppelbock\" beer combines the finest hops and dark barley malt. The Paulaner monks used to drink Salvator as a food substitute during Lent. The most famous master brewer was Frater Barnabas
