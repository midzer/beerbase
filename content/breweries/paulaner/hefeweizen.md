Paulaner Hefe-Weißbier is the best-selling beer by the Paulaner Brewery. Specially produced top-fermented yeast is what gives it its unmistakeable character: sparkling light, fruity, and just a tiny bit bitter. Because it is not filtered during the brewing process, it retains its originality and the many vitamins, minerals and trace elements.

Hefe Weissbier Naturtrüb:
12.5% original wort; 5.5% alcohol; 44 kcal/100 ml
