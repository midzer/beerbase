or more than 200 years the Westmalle Trappists have chosen a life of prayer and work. That is their true vocation, entirely in accordance with the rule of Saint Benedict. Monks, he stipulates, have to provide for themselves. hus there is also a brewery within the abbey. The monks deliberately keep production small, with special care for man and the environment. And because profit is not their motive, they spend the surplus from it on charity work and on people in need.
