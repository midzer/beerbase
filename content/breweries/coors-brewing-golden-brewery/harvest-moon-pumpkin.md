This amber-colored, naturally pumpkin flavored ale is brewed only in the autumn and combines the flavor of vine-ripened pumpkin and spices. If you're in the mood for something unique and different to go along with the change of season, autumn is the perfect time to try Blue Moonâ„¢ Pumpkin Ale. Available mid-September through December.
