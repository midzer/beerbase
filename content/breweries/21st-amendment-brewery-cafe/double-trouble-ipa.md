Deep, golden, rich malt flavor huge citrus, fruity grassy, ethanol sweetness aroma with a profound bitterness, yet balanced malt back bone with grapefruit, mellow citric overtones. Dry hopped three times in the fermenter. Brewed with over 65 lbs of hops for 300 gallons of beer. The beer to bring world peace and end the war. Bronze Medal - 2006 Imperial IPA Festival at the Bistro in Hayward, California.
