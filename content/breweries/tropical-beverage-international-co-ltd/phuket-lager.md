Phuket Beer was created as a refreshing â€˜boutiqueâ€™ beer in view of the exotic island of Phuket with a much lower formula of bitterness than any other domestic rivals in Thailand.

Phuket Beer is the first regional beer brewed in Thailand and is positioned to appeal to both the international markets as well as the local population. This is manifested through the label and packaging designs presented in both English and Thai languages.

Phuket Beer is well positioned as a premium brand located somewhere between the local standard brands and the imported premium brands. The efforts were inspired from the feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.

The philosophy is to provide a â€˜tropical lifestyleâ€™ drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content.
