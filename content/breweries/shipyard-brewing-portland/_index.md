Since 1994, Shipyard Brewing Company has been brewing fine quality products with a wide range of style profiles. We use only top quality ingredients and pride ourselves on the consistency and freshness of our products. All our beer is hand crafted from recipes developed by master brewer Alan Pugsley, one of the most influential people in the craft brewing movement in North America.  Shipyard is available in 35+ states around the country and markets for our freshly brewed, hand-crafted beers continue to expand.
