Our Belgian Style White beer is smooth, tangy and very thirst quenching. Brewed with a delicate combination of oats, wheat and barley malt, we season it ever so lightly with hops. Then we add sprinklings of coriander and orange peel for a refreshing brew with a citrus aroma. Don't be fooled by the cloudy appearance, that's expected of a classic Belgian-style \Whitbier\" or white beer."
