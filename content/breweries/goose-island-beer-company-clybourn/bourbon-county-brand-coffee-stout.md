Everyday Goose Island smells the wonderful coffee roasting next to our brewery at Chicago's Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea. They put the same passion and skill into their coffee as Goose Island does with its beer. This excellent stout is made with Black Cat Espresso beans from our friends next door. You'll like the combination.
