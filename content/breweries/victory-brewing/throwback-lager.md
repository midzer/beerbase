Our Crisp, lighter in body, yet still full flavored brew.  Before Prohibition, thirst quenching lagers were firm and substantial, and enjoyed in huge volumes. This recipe incorporates yeast from the C. Schmidt Brewery of Philadelphia and a small portion of brewer's corn to recreate an \industrial\" lager of the turn of the century. 

Released April 6 to celebrate Prohibition's repeal 73 yrs. ago
