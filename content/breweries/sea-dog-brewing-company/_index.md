Today, Sea Dog Brewing Company operates brew pubs in two locations. The Sea Dog in Topsham occupies a scenic spot on the Androscoggin River. The Bangor location overlooks the historic Penobscot River. Both locations serve a full menu of handcrafted ales and creative pub fare with a flair. Being authentic is important to us. Our beers are brewed in a traditional style using only the highest quality ingredients like imported English two-row malted barley and British top-fermenting yeast. Our English brewing style results in brews with a distinctive, refreshing taste and crisp finish unique to top-fermented beers.
