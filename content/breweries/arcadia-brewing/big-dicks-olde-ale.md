Somewhat of a cousin to Barleywine, Big Dick’s is a classic English-style Olde Ale.  Sweet and full-bodied malt flavors are complemented by a fragrant but mild hop bitterness.  Sweet, bready malt aromas combine with rich flavors of dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and sweet nuts. A beer for keeping, Big Dick’s Olde Ale will age gracefully, while fruity flavors continue to develop and bitterness will subside.

This is not only a BIG beer, it is a Well-Endowed Ale!  We took a traditional English-style Ale and made it our own.  Delightful on its own or as a digestif with a full-bodied cigar, Big Dick’s is also big enough to stand up to many boldly-flavored foods.
