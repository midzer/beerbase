Iron City Brewing Company is Pittsburgh born and brewed. We've been a Pittsburgh tradition since 1861. That was the year a German immigrant by the name of Edward Frauenheim founded Iron City Brewery and began a legacy of producing quality beers and lagers in the city of Pittsburgh. Today, the new Iron City Brewing Company is poised to carry on a tradition that is synonymous with pride, innovation and the Western Pennsylvania region. The new Iron City Brewing Company is committed to its employees, its customers, and the community. We have an experienced team with deep resources that is dedicated to making Iron City Brewing Company a successful brewery that the region can be proud to call its own.
