Pranqster
Belgian Style Golden Ale

Belgian Ales represent the height of the brewers' art. Sophisticated brewing techniques, yeast blends and unique flavoring elements have elevated the beers of Belgium to the status enjoyed by wine in other countries.

PranQster follows in this tradition using a mixed culture of antique yeast strains that produce a floral nose, a full fruity flavor and a clean finish.

Available in 12oz 4 packs and 750 ml traditionally corked and wired bottles.
