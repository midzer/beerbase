We brew our beer in the heart of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania with great respect for the old traditions of brewing. Our master brewer, Christian Heim, has a strong commitment to quality and uses advanced brewing techniques to produce a consistent and high quality beer. Savor the hopped aromas as they come alive and accentuate the wholesome malt flavors in our ales and lagers.
