A mighty lager-style brew, dark in color. Our Doppelbock brings a big malty sweetness together with the classic lager smoothness, topped off with a slightly evident alcohol flavor. A toasty brew to battle even the coldest winter nights.

Available at the Brewery and in bottles & cases from March - May.
