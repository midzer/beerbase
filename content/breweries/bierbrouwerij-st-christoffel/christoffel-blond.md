Born as “Christoffel Bier” this was the first beer brewed by Christoffel. After the introduction of Christoffel Robertus, this beer was named Blond refering to the colour of the beer.  Blond is a low-fermenting beer with 6% alc.vol.

Blond has a full body, a very balanced taste and a beautiful bitterness due to a generous addition of fresh hop during the brewing-process. The aroma is fruity and Blond has a fresh taste with a pleasant, hoppy finish.
