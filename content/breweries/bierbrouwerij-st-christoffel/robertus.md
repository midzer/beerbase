Christoffel Robertus is a low-fermenting ruby-red beer, brewed in the MÃ¼nchener-style. It is a malty, fresh beer with a light sweetness. The typical hop bitterness found in Blond, is very lightly present in Robertus. The use of an extensive amount of selected barley gives Robertus the special malty taste and aroma.
