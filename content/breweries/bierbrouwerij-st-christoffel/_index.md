Beerbrewery St. Christoffel is a relatively young brewery, founded in 1986. Our brewery is situated in the former coalmining-town Roermond in Dutch Limburg and named after the patronsaint of Roermond: Saint Christoffel. The brewery started very small and was at first situated behind a house. In 1995 the brewery moved to her present facility. With moving there, the brewingcapacity greatly enhanced due to new brewing-, fermenting- and lagerfacilities. Christoffel brews according to the German Reinheitsgebot von 1516: which means the brewingprocess takes place in a completely natural way. Around the year 1990, Christoffel Blond was awarded 3 years in a row with the Dutch title: Best Beer from the Netherlands.
