Sometimes it's good to keep it simple. 

Harborfields HefeWeizen is modeled after the German classic, but meant to be available fresh (like you would enjoy if you were in Germany). Shipping over long distances is not always a friend to beer. 

Named for the Centerport-Greenlawn area of Long Island that is home to the Blind Bat Brewery, Harborfields Hefeweizen goes great with fish, chicken, or a summer salad. Some even like it with brunch! (Please enjoy your waffles responsibly.)
