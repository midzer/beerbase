Named Grande RÃ©serve in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, it is principally distinguished by its character of a strong beer. 

This is a beer whose fragrance of fresh yeast with a light, flowery rosy touch is especially pleasant. 

Its flavour, noticed when tasting it, only accentuates the pleasant sensations perceived in the aroma , while revealing a light but pleasant touch of roasted malt.

This top fermented Trappist beer , refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised.
