Originally brewed exclusively for beer shows, this award-winning ale has always been a Brau Brothers favorite! This is not your typical Scotch Ale. Combined with traditional malt
sweetness is a distinct smoke flavor derived from authentic peat-smoked malt. This beer will change your opinion about Scottish ales due to its drinkability. Hop flavor and bitterness are minor, yet balance out this malty beer.

Brau Scotch Ale is copper to amber in color with an off-white head of tightly laced bubbles. Wide-bowled glassware will allow the sweet and smoky aroma to escape. This ale can be served from 34- 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower temps will make it easier to drink while higher temps will enhance both malt and hop flavor. Portion control is important as this beer.
