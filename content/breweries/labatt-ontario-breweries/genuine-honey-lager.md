Genuine Honey Lager was introduced in 2005 in response to consumer demand for honey lagers. Labatt Genuine Honey uses genuine, all-natural, 100% Canadian honey to give consumers a softer, smoother taste. This naturally-aged lager is brewed to the same uncompromising standards applied to every Labatt beer. Genuine Honey Lager is the real thing!
