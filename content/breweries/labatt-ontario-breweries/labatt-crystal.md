Labatt Crystal was introduced to Ontario in the late 1800s as one of the first lagers brewed by Labatt. World-renowned Saaz hops are used to give this beer a clean, almost sweet taste which nicely balances the fuller body, higher bitterness and richer taste typically associated with traditional lagers.
