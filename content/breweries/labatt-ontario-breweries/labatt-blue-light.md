Labatt Blue Light was introduced in 1983 as a lower alcohol, lower calorie version of Canadaâ€™s most popular brand. Blue Light uses specially selected North American aromatic hops and the same strain of lager yeast as the one used to produce Labatt Blue. The result is a crisp, clean and delicately balanced beer, with a slight sweetness and citrus-like hop character.
