Labatt Bleue Dry, the second addition to the Bleue family, is brewed with the same care and attention to detail as Labatt Bleue. Labatt Bleue Dry is mashed longer than regular beers to leave less carbohydrate (sugar) in the finished beer, giving a clean, crisp finish. Using select aromatic hops and a blend of the finest quality North American barley malts, this lager is clean-flavoured with no aftertaste.
