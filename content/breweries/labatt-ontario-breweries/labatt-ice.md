Labatt Ice, introduced in 1993, was the worldâ€™s first Ice-Brewedâ„¢ beer and the most successful new brand introduction in Canadian brewing history. Labatt Ice is a fully fermented beer that is allowed to mature at cold temperatures. Labatt Ice uses selected North American hops to complement its smooth, full flavour.
