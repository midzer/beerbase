In 1888, After enduring one of the coldest winters on record, the employees of Jacob Leinenkugel's spring brewery crafted their first seasonal beer to celebrate the coming of spring. They blended dark and pale roasted malted barley with select hops and allowed for longer aging to create a robust beer with an exceptionally creamy head. Unchanged since 1888, You'll find our bock's sturdy bod and deep color perfect to draw you out of one season and the into next.
