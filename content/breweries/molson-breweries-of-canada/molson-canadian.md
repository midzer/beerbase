Molson beers are imported directly from Canada.  Crystal-clear, pure Canadian water, the finest Canadian prairie grains and select European hops give Molson a brewing heritage that dates back to 1786.

Molson Canadian is Molson Brewing Company's flagship brand.  Starting with crystal clear water, malted barley and the finest hops, Molson Canadian is slowly fermented to produce a smooth, refreshing beer with a genuine taste. Clean and clear, crisp and cold, Molson Canadian is a classic lager.
