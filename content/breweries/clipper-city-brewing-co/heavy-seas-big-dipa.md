Big DIPA – Double IPA,  is the first in the Heavy Seas Special Edition Series due to be released in mid June.  Hopped 3 times in the brewing process, Big DIPA has an earthy hop aroma.  In keeping with the Heavy Seas philosophy we've made a big beer with a surprising balance. The best part is that you’ll hardly notice it’s 10.6% ABV (est). The label artwork was created by Kurt Krol, one of our brewers who also helped to develop the recipe.
