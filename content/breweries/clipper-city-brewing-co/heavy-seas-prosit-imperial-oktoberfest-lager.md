Malt focused, made with five types of grain including Vienna and Munich malts â€“ plus a secret extra malt that we use only in our Prosit! Consider this bomber to be the burly big brother to our Clipper City MarzHon, a three year in a row winner at the Great American Beer Festival. Weâ€™ve balanced the sweetness of the malt with three kinds of hops making this one of the boldest marzen style lagers youâ€™ll ever try.
