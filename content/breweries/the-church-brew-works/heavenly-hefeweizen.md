I’m sure everyone here knows, Pittsburgh has some humid summers.  What can you do to escape the heat and enjoy yourself?  Well I’ve got the answer.  How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because I’m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.
