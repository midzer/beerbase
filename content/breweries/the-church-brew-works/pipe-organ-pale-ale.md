When the British introduced draught pale ale to America, the Pipe Organ Pale Ale is what they had intended. It is truly British in character. Brewed with pale ale malt and a touch of caramel malt, it has a light copper color and subtle body. The maltiness is carefully balanced with only the best English hops - East Kent Goldings. Although this beer has a fair amount of hops, the caramel maltiness perfectly balances its profile.
