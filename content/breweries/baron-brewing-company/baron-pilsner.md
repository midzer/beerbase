Our pilsner is a traditional Northern German Style Pilsner. It has a fantastic malty aroma with a slight spice from the hops. The head is brilliant white and floats on the clean pale lager. The sparkling mouthfeel gives way to a soft malt sweetness that is followed by a long, dry, crisp finish. The balanced clean finish taunts the mouth to take another drink. Lagered for a minimum of 8-12 weeks to ensure smoothness and drinkability.

All ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.
