The Baron Oktoberfest is a traditional German Style Oktoberfest / Marzen. Deep copper/amber in color with a rich but light malt flavor. Finishes crisp and easy, leaving the mouth desiring more. We age the Oktoberfest for a full three months to guarantee a fantastically smooth beer.

All ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.
