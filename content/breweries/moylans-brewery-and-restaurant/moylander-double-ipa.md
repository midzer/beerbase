“If One is Good, Then Two is Better!” Our Moylander Double IPA is fat and resiny, with aggresive and excessive hops swinging on on an enormous malt backbone like naughty monkeys on a vine. Double malt, double hops - do the math, it’s academic. This brew has twice the things you’re looking for, and it’s big enough to share with the one you love. And isn’t that what it's all about?
