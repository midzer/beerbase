â€œIf One is Good, Then Two is Better!â€� Our Moylander Double IPA is fat and resiny, with aggresive and excessive hops swinging on on an enormous malt backbone like naughty monkeys on a vine. Double malt, double hops - do the math, itâ€™s academic. This brew has twice the things youâ€™re looking for, and itâ€™s big enough to share with the one you love. And isnâ€™t that what it's all about?
