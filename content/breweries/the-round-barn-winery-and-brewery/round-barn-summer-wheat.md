An unpretentious American pale wheat beer, our Summer Wheat pours a cloudy golden-orange, just like a sunset over Lake Michigan. Its assertive wheat flavor is complimented with hints of citrus zest. Garnish with a slice of orange or lemon. Round Barn beer is bottle conditioned, decant into a weizen glass before drinking for the best taste experience.
