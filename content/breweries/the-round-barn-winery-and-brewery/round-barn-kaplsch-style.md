Our KÃ¶lsch style beer is a golden-blonde ale that is our version of Cologne's native style. Soft, subtle maltiness and a clean finish make it a great thirst-quencher. KÃ¶lsch pairs well with spicy foods, or by itself. Enjoy with friends and in good health. Round Barn beer is bottle conditioned, decant into a pint glass before drinking for the best taste experience.
