Beer of top fermentation, Belzebuth represents the achievement of a more than one hundred year-old know-how, the one of the Brewery Grain d'Orge. Under its copper colour, it hides a strong character for the lovers of sensations. It owes its strength to the subtle mixture of pure malts, hops and yeasts especially selected by our Master-Brewer.

At one time this beer was 15%. After the name change it was lowered to 13%.
