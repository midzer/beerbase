Schloss Eggenberg Urbock 23Â° is one of the strongest beers in the world. We keep the Urbock 23Â° in our Schloss cellars for 9 months until it is dark gold and strongly matured. Urbock 23Â° has received the highest acknowledgments and honours at international exhibitions and world evaluations. It is brewed exclusively from natural raw ingredients after the purity requirement of 1516. Schloss Eggenberg Urbock is filled in a 0.33 litre designer bottle embossed with Schloss Eggenberg and in barrels for the export (20 and 30 litre).
