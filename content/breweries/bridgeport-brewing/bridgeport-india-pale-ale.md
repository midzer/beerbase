Our award-winning IPA sparkles with effervescence, the result of natural-conditioning, a process where the beer is double-fermented in each bottle, keg or cask. Brewed with a blend of five hop varieties, BridgePort IPA presents a floral, citrusy aroma and full hop flavor, while downplaying the bitterness.  The beer pours smooth in the glass, emitting its signature golden glow.
