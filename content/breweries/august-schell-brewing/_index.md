The August Schell Brewing Company is a brewing company in New Ulm, Minnesota. It was founded by German immigrants August Schell and Jacob Bernhardt in 1860 and passed into the possession of the Schell family in 1866. It is the second oldest family-owned brewery in America and became the oldest and largest brewery in Minnesota when the company bought the Grain Belt rights in 2002.
