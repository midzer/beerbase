The Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale is an American brown ale brewed with loads of hops from start to finish (itâ€™s hoppy and beautifully bitter). Amarillo hops in the boil provide a spicy citrusy bitterness. Saaz dry hops in the fermentor provide a refined flowery aroma. These hops are supported by a grain bill of seven varieties of malt. Oh yeah!
