The Duck-Rabbit Porter is very dark in color. This robust porter features a pronounced flavor of roasted grains reminiscent of dark chocolate. Also, Paul and Brandon add oats to the grist to give a subtle round silkiness to the mouthfeel. We’re confident that you’re really going to love this yummy porter!
