Thomas Hooker's traditional Irish-Style Red Ale gets its warm, ruby color from an interesting blend of pale, caramel and roasted malts which promote a sweetness that's balanced with crisp, authentic, English-style hops. A very unique and drinkable red ale that's also favored by amber lovers.
Hooker Irish Red is drinks well year-round, not just on St. Paddy's day.
