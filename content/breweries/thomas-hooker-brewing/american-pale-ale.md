Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale is an extremely vivid, medium-bodied brew. Hooker Pale Ale stresses the crisp bitterness, lingering resin flavor, and aroma of American hops which are characteristic of the most distinctive West Coast Ales. The caramel sweetness of the malt balances the chock-full-of-hops flavor to yield a complex but quite refreshing brew.
