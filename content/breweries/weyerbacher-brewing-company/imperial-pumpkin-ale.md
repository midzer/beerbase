Yes that's right!  The mother of all Pumpkin Ales is currently in transit to our wholesalers and should be out on shelves around mid-September.  This 8.0% ABV pumpkin ale is heartier, spicier, and more \caramelly\" and \"pumpkiny\" than its faint brethren!  
  Perfect finisher on a cool autumn night
