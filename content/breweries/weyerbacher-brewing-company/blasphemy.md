First released in March 2007,  Blasphemy is our award winning QUAD aged in bourbon barrels.  But not overaged, so we've picked up gentle vanilla oaky notes which complement rather than supercede the complex qualities that already make QUAD such an incredible beer.  Expected to be an annual Spring seasonal, supplies are limited.  ABV is 11.8%.
