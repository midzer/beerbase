The latest in our Brewersâ€™ Select One-offs, India is a West Coast style IPA at [7.2%] ABV, with incredibly delicious hoppiness! Golden in color, this beer is tilted way over toward the hops by way of less specialty malts used in the mash. Draft will be going out to select wholesalers in PA, NJ, FL, and MD.â€� 70+ IBUâ€™s.
