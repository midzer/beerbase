In 750ml corked â€™nâ€™ caged bottles this will be and unfiltered, fully bottle conditioned version of the super popular Double Simcoe. Expect Cask taste in a bottle, with more pronounced hoppy flavor and aroma due to being unfiltered. Also, carbonation will be a bit higher as is usual in our cork n cage series in keeping with tradition. It all comes together to form a uniquely great experience for hopheads.
