Insanity, just released this past November, 2004, is Weyerbacher's latest creation in the world of cutting edge beers. Insanity is made by aging our perfectly balanced Blithering Idiot Barleywine in  oak bourbon casks. This incredible combination creates a melange of flavors such as malt, dates, oak, vanilla, and bourbon just to name a few.

  Insanity is 11.1% ABV. It is best enjoyed in a brandy snifter and served at 45-50 degrees F.
