Decadence is our Tenth Anniversay spiced amber ale.  This is a very limited production, brewed only once, to celebrate ten fantastic years in business.  This ale weighs in at 13% ABV and is a fantastic sipper, especially after dinner or consider paring it with a good book on a cool fall evening.  Decadence is brewed with honey, cardamom spice and gentian (a rare botanical!)  This ale is very unique and will develop finer character when aged at cellar temperatures.
