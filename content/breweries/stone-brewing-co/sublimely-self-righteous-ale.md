Brace yourself, bereaved fans of Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, for your joyous new day has finally come! Itâ€™s like your first crushâ€“you know, the one who broke your heart when she/he decided to go to the junior prom with whatâ€™s-their-nameâ€“has suddenly come back to you to go for a cruise down the main drag on Friday night. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦itâ€™s like finding that long lost gold watch, given to you by your father, who got it from his father, who got it from his father. Itâ€™s like when your best buddy in the world, Sam the family dog, finally sauntered up the front porch steps one sunny afternoon after having been on a six-week runaway. Yes, itâ€™s just like that.

And itâ€™s like this: A brilliantly hopped double IPAâ€“providing a wake up call of floral and citrus aromasâ€“backed up by a deliciously smooth and dark roasted maltiness. You get the best of both worlds with this black double IPA.
