Brace yourself, bereaved fans of Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, for your joyous new day has finally come! It’s like your first crush–you know, the one who broke your heart when she/he decided to go to the junior prom with what’s-their-name–has suddenly come back to you to go for a cruise down the main drag on Friday night. It’s like…it’s like finding that long lost gold watch, given to you by your father, who got it from his father, who got it from his father. It’s like when your best buddy in the world, Sam the family dog, finally sauntered up the front porch steps one sunny afternoon after having been on a six-week runaway. Yes, it’s just like that.

And it’s like this: A brilliantly hopped double IPA–providing a wake up call of floral and citrus aromas–backed up by a deliciously smooth and dark roasted maltiness. You get the best of both worlds with this black double IPA.
