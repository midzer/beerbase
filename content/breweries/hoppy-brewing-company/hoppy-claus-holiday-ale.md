Our Holiday Ale is a “special” version of our flagship product - Hoppy Face™ Amber Ale; only bigger for you to enjoy during this holiday season!!! Characterized by its distinctive hop aroma and rich, ruby color, Hoppy Claus redefines the way you think about a holiday ale. Hoppy Claus uses only the finest two row malted barley, hops grown in the great Pacific Northwest, and some secret spices that we would love to tell you about; but are unable to do so. This combination results in a clean, crisp, and refreshingly unique hand-crafted experience. Hoppy Brewing Company has never used any artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors in any of its ales. The Hoppy label is your guarantee of purity.
