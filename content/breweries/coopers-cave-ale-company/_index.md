Cooper's Cave Ale Company, Ltd. Micro Brewery is the realized goal of three ale lovers, Ed, Pat and Adrian Bethel. A passion for great English style ales led us to commercially produce small quantities on a brewing system which we built. We gladly welcome visitors to our brewery and tasting room, and now we welcome you to learn more about Cooper's Cave Ale Company.
