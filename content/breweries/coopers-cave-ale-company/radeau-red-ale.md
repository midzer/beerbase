Cooper's Cave Ale Company's flagship ale is an Irish Red Ale. Three English Malts and one Belgian Munich Malt make up the grain bill. It is a full bodied Red Ale packed with flavor, blended with American Nugget hops for bitterness and East Kent Golding for flavor and aroma. This ale has turned the heads of many dyed in the wool" American lager drinkers."
