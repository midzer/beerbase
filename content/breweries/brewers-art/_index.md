Set in a grand Mt. Vernon townhouse, The Brewer's Art offers many temptations for your palate. Our seasonally-influenced menu of European-style country fare features meats, fish, seafood, pasta, and vegetarian offerings.  Dinner is served daily between 5:30pm - 9:00pm (later on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays) and light fare is available from 4:00pm - 11:00pm. Our creative pastry chef prepares our homemade desserts. In addition to brewing our fine beers on the premises, we offer a carefully picked selection of beers and fine wines from around the world, and one of Baltimore's best selections of scotches and spirits.
