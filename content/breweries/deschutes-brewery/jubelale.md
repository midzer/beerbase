Did you know that Jubelale was the first beer ever bottled by Deschutes Brewery?  Highly anticipated every fall, Jubelale is in a category of its own with a flavor and following that is impossible to match.  Dark crystal malt creates that â€œlusciousâ€� holiday note while the roasty flavor and bountiful hops excite your tastebuds, reminding you why Jubelale is the perfect holiday beer
