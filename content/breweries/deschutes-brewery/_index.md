Deschutes Brewery, located in Central Oregon along the banks of the wild and scenic Deschutes River, has brewed handcrafted traditional ales since 1988.  Starting out as a small brewpub in the heart of downtown Bend, Deschutes' first beers were Black Butte Porter, Bachelor Bitter and Cascade Golden Ale. In 1993, Deschutes moved into its current brewing facility and has continued expanding and improving the facilities.  With a 50-barrel traditional gravity brew house and a new one-of-a-kind 131-barrel Huppmann brew system from Germany, Deschutes now creates and experiments with specialty batches of limited beers while brewing large quantities of everyone's favorites like Mirror Pond Pale Ale.  Consistently producing the highest quality beers is always Deschutes' number one priority and commitment. The Deschutes Brewery & Public House continues brewing unique beers at our original location while serving the finest Northwest pub cuisine.  So when you find yourself in Bend, come on in and have a pint of Bachelor Bitter, the locals' favorite, or any of our other original ales brewed on-site. Deschutes Brewery's distinct ales; Black Butte Porter, Mirror Pond Pale Ale, Obsidian Stout, Inversion IPA, Bachelor ESB, Cascade Ale, Buzzsaw Brown (winter), Cinder Cone Red (spring), Twilight Ale (summer), Jubelale (fall) and other seasonal beers are available at pubs and markets in a neighborhood near you. --http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/About+Us/default.aspx
