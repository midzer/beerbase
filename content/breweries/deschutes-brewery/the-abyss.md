The Abyss has immeasurable depth inviting you to explore and discover its rich, complex profile. Hints of molasses, licorice and other alluring flavors draw you in further and further with each sip. And at 11% alcohol by volume, you will want to slowly savor each and every ounce. 

November 2008 marks the third release of this dark and mysterious imperial stout. Limited availability in wax-dipped 22-ounce bottles and on draft at a few select establishments. 

“The Abyss was one of those beers I didn’t want to end. I was totally blown away - this is precious stuff.” Christian DeBenedetti, beer writer and Men’s Journal contributor
