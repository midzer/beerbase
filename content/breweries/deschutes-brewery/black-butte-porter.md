Towering high above Central Oregon, jetting into clear blue skies, Black Butte can be seen for miles.  From its base flows the legendary Metolius River--with its source hidden deep beneath ancient lava flows. 

Black Butte Porter, crafted from chocolate and crystal malts, is Deschutes Breweryâ€™s flagship brand.  With a rich and distinctive flavor, this porter has enjoyed a loyal and passionate following since its first pint in 1988.
