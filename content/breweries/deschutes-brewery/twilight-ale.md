Stretching the longer summer days into Twilight!  There is something magical about the time of day that falls between light and dark, the high-desert summer day fading into a warm evening with brilliant skies.

Twilight Ale is a lighter, but full flavored ale with a balanced malt profile and a harmonious blend of four hops.  A final dry hopping of bold Amarillos creates the distinctive finishing touch.  Twilight is best enjoyed when chilled and consumed outdoors.
