Modeled after the classic wheat beers of Bavaria, our HefeWeizen has a cloudy, straw-colored appearance with a thick, creamy head. It is fermented with an authentic Weizenbier yeast strain which imparts delicate notes of clove, vanilla and banana which harmonize perfectly with its mild refreshing tartness. Together these flavors create the perfect thirst quencher to beat the Texas heat. Available April - August
