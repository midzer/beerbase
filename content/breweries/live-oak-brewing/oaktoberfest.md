A fall classic, our Oaktoberfest emphasizes rich malt flavor. We use German malt and hops to give it an authentic Bavarian character. The rich, maltiness of this brew is a good match with spicy cuisine, as well as barbecue. Live Oak Oaktoberfest will certainly raise the level of enjoyment at your next fall gathering. Available September - December
