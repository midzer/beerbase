Live Oak Brewing Company is truly a home-grown Austin enterprise. Two of Austin's own homebrews, Chip McElroy and Brian Peters, literally hand-built the brewery and were the two main brewers, keg washers, delivery persons, and proselytizers. Live Oak has grown since then, but we are still just as passionate about providing delicious old-world style beers that are rarely commercially available. Our special beers are brewed in limited quantities in a small east Austin brewery and are available in fine pubs and restaurants in Austin, Dallas, Houston, Alpine, Marathon, San Marcos and San Antonio.
