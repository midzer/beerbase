Extra Special Bitter Ale. Alaskan ESB is darker and hoppier and is brewed and fermented at different temperatures than our popular Alt-style Amber. It has an exquisite copper color derived from Crystal malt and an aggressive, yet pleasant hop character.

Malty with roasted overtones, Alaskan ESB has a crisp finish resulting from the use of premium Northwest hops.

Alaskan ESB is made from glacier-fed water and a generous blend of the finest quality European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.
