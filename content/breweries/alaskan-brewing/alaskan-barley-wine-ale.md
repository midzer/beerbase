Alaskan Barley Wine is produced in small batches each year. Typically this higher alcohol beverage is brewed in the spring, cellared in the tunnels of the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mine for the summer and retrieved in time for its release at the Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival in January. The cool tunnels of the mine shaft provide natural refrigeration and a prime environment for the aging process. 

Like a fine wine, Alaskan Barley Wine can be aged for years. The bottling of the 2007 vintage of Alaskan Barley Wine will allow individuals to age it to their liking. â€œWe figured weâ€™d leave it up to individuals as to how long to age their Alaskan Barley Wine,â€ said Quality Assurance Analyst Ryan Harvey. â€œSome people like barley wines fresh, and others store it for years.â€
