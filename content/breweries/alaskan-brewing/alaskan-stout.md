Oatmeal Stout. The origins of Oatmeal Stout go back hundreds of years when oats were added to Stouts to promote a healthier image than other beers available during that time period.

The unique blend of the oats and malts in Alaskan Stout produce a balanced, smooth beer with hints of coffee and caramel.

Alaskan Stout is made from glacier-fed water and a generous belnd of European and Pacific Northwest hop varieties and premium two-row and specialty malts. Our water originates in the 1,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and the from the more than 90 inches of rainfall Juneau receives each year.
