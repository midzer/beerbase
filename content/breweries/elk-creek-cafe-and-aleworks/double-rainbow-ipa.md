Named for the spectacular and complete double rainbow that appeared in the northwest sky just outside the brewhouse during the inaugural mash in. With a foot in both the new and old worlds, this IPA is generously dry-hopped with English Fuggles, resulting in a strong, deep golden, very fresh, and fruity English flavor and aroma.
