An American style India Pale Ale. This medium bodied, light bronze hued brew has an aggressive hop character and flavor from the use of American hops in dry hopping. Our interpretation comes in at 13.0 degrees plato with IBU’s in the mid 40’s. The American hop varietals used as Kettle additions were Amarillo and Chinook and this was dry hopped with Chinook as well.
