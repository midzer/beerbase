Located in historic Ipswich, Massachusetts, Mercury Brewing Company emerged in 1999 when Rob Martin, then Director of Operations for Ipswich Brewing Company, purchased the brewery and renamed the company Mercury Brewing and Distribution Company. While continuing production of Ipswich Ale, Martin expanded the company with Stone Cat Ales and Lagers, Mercury Premium Sodas, and numerous contract brewing agreements.  In 2007 our beer production topped 14,000 BBLs (434,000 GAL), a 44% increase from 2006. Soda production came to 1180 BBLs (36,580 GAL), an increase of 22% from the previous year. We could not have done this without our hardworking staff and loyal customers and look forward to an even better 2008.
