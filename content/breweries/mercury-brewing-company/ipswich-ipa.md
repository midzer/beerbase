Our IPA is an unfiltered cross between an English and American IPA, with a strong, dry bitterness balanced with a slight malty sweetness. A mixture of first-rate U.S. and Belgian malts, combined with English roasted barley and highly hopped with Cascade and Warrior hops make our IPA a brewery favorite.
