The Brewery was officially brewing in October 2002 and was incorporated in 1994 as the New Albanian Brewing Company in a room that branches off of Sportstime Pizza. The brewery established by Roger Baylor his wife Amy (O'Connell) Baylor and her sister Kate O'Connel. This is the first commercial brewery in New Albany since 1935. The first brewmaster was Michael Borchers which brought with him experience and used machines from the now defunct Silver Creek Brewing Corporation that was located in Sellersburg, Indiana. Jared Williamson and Jesse Williams are the current brewers working the brewery. In 2005, 14,000 gallons of beer was produced by the brewery, and with the new additions, the planned output for 2007 is double the 2005 amount.
