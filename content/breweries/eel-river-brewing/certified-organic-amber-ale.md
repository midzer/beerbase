Eel River Brewing Company, brewers of California's first Certified Organic Ale, proudly brings you our Organic Amber Ale. Unique in flavor and purity, this medium bodied beer has a hoppy bouquet and a distinctive rich taste with a caramel-like sweetness that is balanced with a liberal dose of certified organic Pacific Gems and Hallertau hops, imported from New Zealand. Pure taste, pure ingredients, pure good.
