This special German-style ale is still made faithfully in Dusseldorf, just down the road from Cologne. Our interpretation is light brown in color and cleanly malty, with a crisp hoppy bitterness in the finish. 
Brewed with organic Pilsner and Munich malt; Chocolate and wheat malt, and imported Spalt hops.
