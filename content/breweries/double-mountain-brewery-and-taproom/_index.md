Matt Swihart and Charlie Devereux founded Double Mountain in 2007 with a clear mission: make great beer for craft beer fans. Ours is a brewers' brewery, with an uncompromising focus on beer quality. From the beginning, our goal was to make beers that we liked to drink. All of our beers are served up unfiltered and long-aged, to deliver maximum flavor and character. The beers can be very complex and assertive, but with the ultimate goal of proper balance. We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.
