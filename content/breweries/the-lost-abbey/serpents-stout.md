The history of the bible and religion is indeed the struggle of good vs. evil. Our Serpentâ€™s Stout recognizes the evil of the dark side that we all struggle with. This is a massively thick and opaque beer that begs the saints to join the sinners in their path to a black existence. 10.5% ABV and available in 750 ml bottles and on draft at select locations.
