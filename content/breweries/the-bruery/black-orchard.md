Black Orchard is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned Belgian-style black wheat beer, or â€œblack witâ€, if you will. This dark but surprisingly light bodied beer is very drinkable while still having character and complexity. Chamomile is added for its floral aroma, while the coriander and citrus peel give the characteristics of a traditional witbier.
