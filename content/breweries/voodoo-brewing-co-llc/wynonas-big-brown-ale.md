This is named after a song that sparked the idea to make this ale. Brown ales seem to be there, but not really there, do you know what I mean? Well that won't be the mistake with Wynona! We Voodooed out this style and added more that's what we say. Mildly hoppy and smooth with hints of chocolate and tons of brown malt to let you know it's there. Currently 7.3% by vol. 

Bottle conditioned and Refermented. 

Get down with the brown, You'll be Happy You Did!!
