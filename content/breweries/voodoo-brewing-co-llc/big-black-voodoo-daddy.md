This is our Imperial Stout that we age in conditioning tanks with oak staves.  This adds a classic character of old world aging with out the Bourbon tones. This black ale is about 12% alc. and very rich in roasted and chocolate malt tones.  Velvety smooth and able tobe aged for years. For now this will be a Seasonal Beer Offering. 

All Beers to be bottle conditioned and Refermented.
