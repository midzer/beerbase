This Wheat ale is made with a little Voodoo Twist. We use our house Belgian Ale yeast and add the average unmalted wheat, wheat, barley,raw oats, malted rye and just add more of each. Hopped evenly and spiced with coriander, bitter and sweet orange peel, juniper berries, 12 varieties of peppercorns,lemon grass and caraway. About 6.75% alc by vol. 

Bottle Conditioned and Refermented.  NOT A WIT BIER!!! Just stuff we like in beer that goes great with food. 

This beer is to be the answer to those hot summer days. Blows away carbonated water!!!!!
