Pilzilla is a beer that I've been brewing for years. Each year it gets bigger and bigger. Nicknamed \The beer that took over Tokyo\". It is an unfiltered Keller Bier. Nicley hopped at this point with 9 different kinds of hops at 10 additions and about 6.75 % alc. Each year we will add another variety of hop and bump the alc a bit. This is listed on Beer Advocate as the highest rated Kellerbier in the world. 

Bottle Conditioned and Refermented. 

This is not your average pilsner
