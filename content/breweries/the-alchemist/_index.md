The Alchemist is a 7 barrel brew pub specializing in hand-crafted beer and casual pub fare. All of our ales are brewed in our basement brewery, which was designed and installed by our brewer and co-proprietor John Kimmich. We use only the finest imported malts and domestic hops available to bring you the tastiest and finest selection of beers in Vermont!
