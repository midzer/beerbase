Dark brown with a nice tan head.
Sweet and aromatic.
Smooth and best served cold from a goblet or chalice.

I have had this on tab, in a 12oz bottle and 1 liter bottle.  It is very common on to be on tap in Belgium and Paris as well as in a bottle in the UK.

I have not seen it in the US nor can I find a distributor that could get it.
