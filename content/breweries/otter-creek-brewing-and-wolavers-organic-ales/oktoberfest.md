Oktoberfest is our version of the perennial favorite Bavarian Autumn beer. Oktoberfest's deep golden hue helps bring to mind the old country and its time honored traditions. Brewed with Hallertau and Tettnang hops to balance its clean, malty sweetness, it's the perfect brew for a crisp Autumn day. Available from August to November.
