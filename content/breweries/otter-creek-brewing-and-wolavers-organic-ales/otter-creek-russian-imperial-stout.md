The style was first brewed in England for the Russian Czar and it is the king of stouts. Plenty of big malt flavors- chocolate and roasted- and high alcohol with lower carbonation and mild hops. 
We brewed this beer with double the malts and four times the hops of regular stouts!

Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout clocks in around 10% ABV- a beer to be savored responsibly. True to style, this beer will last for years so you may want to stock up on a few bottles for your cellar while it's available.

Russian Imperial Stouts pair well with creamy cheeses such as camembert (we recommend Vermont-made!), decadent chocolate desserts, or a hearty meal.
