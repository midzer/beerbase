A smooth, refined version of a classic ale.
Samuel AdamsÂ® Boston Ale was first brewed to celebrate the opening of our Boston Brewery. Like Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ®, it was an old family recipe that was rescued by Jim Koch from his father's attic. Samuel AdamsÂ® Boston Ale, a Stock Ale, has a complex, caramel malt character balanced with distinct spicy and herbal hop notes. Our proprietary ale yeast imparts a variety of fruit and ester notes in both the nose and flavor which are indicative of the style.
