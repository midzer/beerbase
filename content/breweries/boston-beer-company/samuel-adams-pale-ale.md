Samuel AdamsÂ® Pale Ale is a delicious, lighter bodied beer with a delightfully fresh taste. Its unique blend of two row malts add a rich harmony of sweet flavors that are complimented by the traditional earthy hop character imparted by authentic British hops. The fermentation character of the ale yeast adds a rich bouquet of fruit and ester notes that add another layer of complexity to this popular style
