Jim Koch founded The Boston Beer Company in 1984 because he believed that Americans deserved better beer. Today, we're a team of about 350 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams beers to beer lovers everywhere. We've worked hard for the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any beer in history. Jim has been named an Entrepreneur of the Year by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, most recently Samuel Adams Utopias and Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock.
