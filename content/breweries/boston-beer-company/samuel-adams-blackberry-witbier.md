We brewed this traditional witbier with orange peel and coriander, and then added a hint of blackberry. The flavor is very complex with malt and cereal notes, intense spice and citrus flavors and a smooth, sweet/tart finish. It will be available in January in its own 6-pack and in the Samuel AdamsÂ® Brewmaster's Collection Variety 6 & 12-packs.
