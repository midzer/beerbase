Intense and warming, a meal in a bottle.
One can not help but appreciate Samuel AdamsÂ® Double Bock's huge malt character. We use an enormous amount of malt, half a pound per bottle, to brew this intensely rich lager. Its deep brown-ruby color is all made in the kettle - no black malt is used, resulting in a rich sweetness that is free of the rough taste of burnt malt. All that remains is the velvet smooth flavor and mouthfeel of the two row malt. Samuel AdamsÂ® Double Bock's intense malt character is balanced with a subtle piney, citrus hop note from the German Noble hops.

Due to legal restrictions, Samuel AdamsÂ® Double Bock can not be sold in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia.
