Green Mountain Beverage is nestled in a valley near the historic Green Mountains in Middlebury, Vermont. This is where we operate our Green Mountain Cidery (our own word we created from a derivative of brewery) and we have become the number one producer of premium alcoholic draft ciders in the U.S. Throughout these pristine areas of the Green Mountains, people are committed to preserving nature's beauty and still today carry on the long standing tradition of taking pride in their work and the products they create which are truly special. Here at Green Mountain Beverage, we also carry on these traditions. Our ciders are a unique combination of nature's best ingredients, our skills, commitment and pride in our work.
