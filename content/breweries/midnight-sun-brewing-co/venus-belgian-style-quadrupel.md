Venusâ€”goddess of love and beautyâ€”exudes grace and voluptuousness. Indulgent with lush dark malts and sensuous star anise, VENUS is decadent and divine in body and spirit. Leisure lounging in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks results in a lovely liquid feast of fabulously luxurious flavors.
