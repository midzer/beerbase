Beer Description:
This double bock provides smooth sailin' in rough seas. The fact that this luscious lager was aged in rum barrels creates the illusion that the open sea is a safe place. And while riding out these waves of grain, you may fall victim to the dangers of pirates, rum, bock. OK...maybe the beach is a bit over-rated.
