RondyBrew 2009 is a rendezvous of playful pale malts and feisty American hops, designed to exhilarate your winter-weary soul. This copper-colored ale delivers citrusy and refreshing hop aroma and flavor.

This year’s label features Rondy’s hottest event: The Running of the Reindeer. If you’re suffering from cabin fever, get out and run with the herd. But ready, set, RUN because this beer is only available for a limited time.

RondyBrew adds refreshment and celebration to the festive fare and entertaining events enjoyed during Anchorage’s Fur Rondy Festival.
