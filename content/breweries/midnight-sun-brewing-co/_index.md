Since firing up its brew kettle in 1995, Midnight Sun Brewing Company has become a serious yet creative force on the American brewing front. From concept to glass, Midnight Sun relies on an art marries science approach, mixing tradition with innovation, to design and craft bold, distinctive beers for Alaska...and beyond. We at Midnight Sun find inspiration in the untamed spirit and rugged beauty of the Last Frontier and develop unique beers with equally appealing names and labels. But the company's true focus remains in its dedication to producing consistently high-quality beers that provide satisfying refreshment in all seasons... for Alaskans and visitors alike.  From our Pacific Northwest locale, we offer our wonderful beers on draft throughout Alaska and in 22-ounce bottles throughout Alaska and Oregon. We invite you to visit our hardworking, little brewery in South Anchorage every chance you get!
