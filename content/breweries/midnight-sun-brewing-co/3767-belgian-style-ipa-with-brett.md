The extensive distance between two breweries on the West Coast â€“ 3767 miles â€“ is bridged by this collaboration beer. Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. 

Just prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. 
The plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Hereâ€™s to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry. Clink!
