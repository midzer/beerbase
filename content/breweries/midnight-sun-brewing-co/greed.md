With a summer release in mind, GREED Belgian-style Single was created miserly—relatively speaking—with one type of malt and two varieties of hops. At 5% ABV and 30 IBUs, Greed is the lightest in our series of 2007 Deadly Sin Beers. However, the Belgian yeast used in fermentation and conditioning contributes an earthy, somewhat spicy flavor and a crisp finish. We invite you to be greedy before it’s gone. 

GREED...Less [for you] is More [for me].
