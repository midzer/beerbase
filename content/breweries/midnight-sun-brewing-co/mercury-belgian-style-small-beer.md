Messenger of the gods, Mercury symbolizes commerce, travel, thievery, wit and wealth. MERCURY cleverly stole its essence from mistress lover VENUS. Second runnings of the voluptuous quadrupel created this small yet fascinating beer. Indian coriander acknowledges the traveler; a distinct Belgian yeast contributes wit & charm.
