Dark and full-bodied, Mammoth Extra Stout boasts a well-rounded melange of rich flavors, including chocolate, caramel, coffee, nut and date. Huge portions of pale and specialty malts give this mammoth brew a complex yet exceptionally smooth palate. Hops provide balance without overpowering the chewy malt profile.
