Chaotic yet hypnotic, Mayhem is a deliberate Double IPA, brewed and conditioned with a special Belgian yeast that contributes complexity and spice. Abundant American hops offer grapefruit, pine, must and mint, which play off the fullness and sweetness of pale malts then provide a biting yet enticing finish.

Mayhem Double IPA accents the complex spice combinations found in Thai, Indian, Cajun, Morrocan, Mexican and Southwest American cuisines as well as BBQ marinades, dry rubs and sauces.

Mayhem creates MAYHEM.
