Oosik Amber Ale is a true German-style altbier, brewed with pale, Munich and crystal malts. Deep amber with copper highlights, Oosik sports a toasted and caramel malt profile, balanced by traditional noble hops. A special yeast strain ferments this ale at cooler lager temperatures, giving it a smooth malt character and a clean finish. 

Want to hangâ€”so to speakâ€”for a while? Oosik Amber Ale gives you hang time. Great flavor, big mouthfeel, satisfying finishâ€¦all in a session-worthy beer. Compare it to other ambersâ€”Oosik rules. Look for our 20-inch Oosik tap in better beer bars throughout AK. 

You can't just have a little Oosik.
