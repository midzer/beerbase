SPECIAL COMMEMORATIVE BEER

Former brewer Ken Pajak teamed up with MSBC to create a very special beer to celebrate the 10 years that he and wife Shauna have owned Café Amsterdam. Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a “beer & wine license” and subsequently transformed the European-style café into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. 

The cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right— temperature, glass, presentation. 

“No hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.” 

Gruit is an old style—one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Café Amsterdam’s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings.
