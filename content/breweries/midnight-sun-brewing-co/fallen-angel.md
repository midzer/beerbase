Fallen Angel Golden Strong Ale, brewed on 6-6-6, is named in the tradition of Belgian golden strong ales--after the devil himself. 

Midnight Sun's Fallen Angel Golden Strong Ale is a traditional Belgian-style golden ale--beautiful gold in color with tiny, conniving bubbles forming a very thick, meticulous head. Effervescent and crisp, this seriously delicious elixir tempts the palate with apple (oh so Garden of Eden), pear and a little earthy mustiness. Fallen Angel captivates your senses with its lightness and brightness while its 8% ABV strength breathes fire into your soul, warming you from the inside out. 

Angel-like in appearance, the devil is in its strength. 

With its introduction in 2006 and its immediate cult following, Fallen Angel is now brewed and released about once a year.
