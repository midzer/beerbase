LUST Belgian-style Dark Strong Ale stirs shameless desire in men (and women) with its captivating appearance, enticing aroma and satisfying flavors. Aged in bourbon oak barrels for twelve months, Lust is worldly, smooth and decadent. Sour cherries contribute tartness while brettanomyces brings muskiness to this naughty brew. 

The pleasure you derive from this dark beer is beyond words. 

LUST. Regret. Repent. Repeat.
