With passion and purpose, we present this series of hop-centric beers. Using different hop varieties and brewing techniques, we aim to capture bold, distinct hop characteristics in aroma, flavor and finish. While we explore the
world of hops, we invite you to learn along with us: these beers offer an incredible opportunity to experience the diversity of hops while engaging the palate and obliterating the senses.

Obliteration IV is a tremendous Double Wheat beer. Its aroma is pungent with fragrant notes of citrus, spice, pine and alcohol. An even malt-to-wheat ratio provides a sturdy yet satisfying base for showcasing these high alpha-acid hops, creating flavors and textures that entice then intrigue. An American wheat beer yeast allows Obliteration IV to finish with unadulterated hop bitterness.
