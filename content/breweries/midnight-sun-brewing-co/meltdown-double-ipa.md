The days are long but the season is short. So what gives? Sleep! After doing more before midnight than most Outsiders do in a week, Alaskans deserve some down time. And these moments of relaxation demand more than that ordinary, non-distinct lawn mower beer. Celebrate a day well done with a beer done well—a seriously delicious IPA with some scorchin’ hops. 

Our new seasonal double IPA is designed to keep you incredibly hopped up spring through summer.
