Assistant Brewer Jeremiah works  primarily at Midnight Sun Brewing Company with regular hours at the AK Rock Gym and the occasional shift or two Kaladi Brothers Coffee. To keep up with his weekly work schedule, he enjoys locally roasted coffee in the morning--OK, sometimes in the afternoon as well--and locally brewed beer in the evening-- OK, sometimes in the morning as well. This beer brings two of his worlds together as an incredible antidote for hibernation.
