An epic barleywine, made in the tradition of British Farmhouse Brewing. Lavished with a velvety blend of six different malts this is a warming beer with a lush mouthfeel. The complexities your discriminating palate will detect are ever changing as this barleywine matures. When young, an assertive hop character predominates and with age the beauty of the big malt balance unfolds.
