True to its American heritage, Yuengling Light Lager is an exceptional brew that appeals to consumers who don't want to sacrifice character for a low-calorie light beer. It has been masterfully developed to maintain the full flavor profile akin to our flagship Lager brand. Skillfully pairing a caramel malt flavor and mild hop character creates a beautifully rich-colored beer with deep amber highlights that finishes smooth and clean. With only 99 calories, Yuengling Light Lager is a uniquely refreshing beer that brings new dimension to the meaning light beer.
