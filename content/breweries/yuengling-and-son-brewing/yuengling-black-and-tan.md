Yuengling Original Black & Tan is a pioneer brand that models a traditional English Half & Half. Introduced in 1986, Yuengling produced one of the first hand-crafted draft blends to lead this style of American brewing. Black & Tan combines our popular Dark Brewed Porter and Premium Beer to create a brew that is rich and dark in color, with a well balanced flavor that finishes smooth and satisfying. It has a faint sweetness with hints of caramel and coffee from the dark roasted malts. One sip and you'll appreciate how Yuengling raised the bar with our Original Black & Tan.
