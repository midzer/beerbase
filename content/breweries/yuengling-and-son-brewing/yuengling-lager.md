Yuengling Traditional Lager is an iconic American lager famous for its rich amber color and medium-bodied flavor. Brewed with roasted caramel malt for a subtle sweetness and a combination of cluster and cascade hops, this true original promises a well balanced taste with very distinct character. Its exceptional flavor and smooth finish is prevalently enjoyed by consumers with even the most discerning tastes. Our flagship brand, Yuengling Traditional Lager is an American favorite delivering consistent quality and refreshment that never disappoints. In fact, it's so widely known and unique in its class, in some areas you can ask for it simply by the name Lager.""
