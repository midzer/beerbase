Yuengling Light Beer is skillfully crafted to deliver a consistently refreshing brew with only 98 calories. Drawing from traditional brewing techniques, our Light Beer is brewed longer to reduce the sugar content and produce fewer calories in each thirst-quenching drink. Its pale golden color is complemented by a light-bodied flavor. Yuengling Light maintains a well balanced character of malt and hops, with slight carbonation for a crisp satisfying finish. We sacrifice nothing to produce a premium light beer that is low in calories and full of flavor. This combination delivers the ultimate refreshment in Yuengling Light Beer.
