Blacksburg Brewing Co. (BBC) is an independent specialty brewer of premium beer.  As mandated by the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law), our beer is brewed with only 4 ingredients: water, barley malt, hops, and yeast.  The best beer requires the best ingredients, so we purchase them regardless of the cost.  We pay a premium to import the Cadillac of barley malt from Bamberg, and our hops from The Hallertau are the best that money can buy, period.
