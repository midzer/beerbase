Daas Blond is the authentic Belgian strong golden beer, its honey spice aroma and perfect balance of bitter sweet flavours are followed by a classic dry hop finish.  A perfect aperitif beer.

Daas Beer is the only Belgian beer brewed in Belgium to carry both the  UK Soil Assoc organic certification and the Belgian Certsys certification whist still upholding its Belgian tradition of brewing excellence using the finest organic ingredients.
