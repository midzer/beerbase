Brewed by the original Wheat Beer Pioneers, Pyramid Apricot Weizen Ale is left unfiltered for extra flavor and aroma. 

The gold medalist of fruit beers, Pyramid Apricot Weizen is an adventurous wheat ale that offers the pleasing aroma and flavor of fresh apricots, and smooth and refreshing character for which our wheat beers are known.
