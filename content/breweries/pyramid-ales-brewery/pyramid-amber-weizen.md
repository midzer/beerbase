Brewed by the original Wheat Beer Pioneers, Amber Weizen is left unfiltered for extra flavor and aroma. 

Rich amber in color, Pyramid Amber Weizen features three different kinds of caramel barley malts and nugget hops resulting in an exceptionally smooth and well-balanced beer that follows in the tradition of our flagship style, Pyramid Hefe Weizen.
