Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter is a rich dark chocolaty Porter with a distinctive American hop character.  It is a great beer to go with hearty foods and is surprisingly one of the few beers that goes well with dessert. One of our favorite combinations here at Ballast Point is Black Marlin Porter with apple pie a la mode.
