This English Session Beer has a delicious floral hop aroma and flavor. A heaping helping of organic caramel malt and touch of organic chocolate malt give this beer its beautiful mahogany color while organic oats from Bob's Red Mill velvetize the texture. Smoother than an infomertial host at half the price!
