Cold Spring Brewery in Cold Spring is on the original Red River trail. Used by the pioneering trail blazers, trappers and settlers to replenish water supplies from the pure cold spring which the town is named today. The spring is one of the purest sources of water in North America.  The spring comes from an underground prehistoric glacial lake filtered through granite over hundreds of years. There are certain pure elements in the water that are absolutely perfect for brewing world class beers.  The brewery has been modernized and rebuilt over the past several years, and is now a state-of-the-art brewery and beverage product development and production facility.
