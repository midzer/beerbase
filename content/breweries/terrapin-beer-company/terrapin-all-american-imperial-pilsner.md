Help us celebrate American Independence and American Beer Month in July with the release of the Terrapin All-American Imperial Pilsner.

This beer was brewed using only American malts, American hops, and American yeast. Who says you have to import ingredients from Germany to make a true Pilsner?

Of course, this Pilsner is made â€œTerrapin Styleâ€. Hence the 75 B.U.â€™s, the 7.5% alcohol and the term â€œIMPERIAL Pilsnerâ€.
