The Brew 1 â€“ March â€“ â€œThe Iron Tankardâ€ Old Stock Ale â€“ The building started as a YMCA in 1889 and had a huge iron swimming pool in the basement.

From Spike: Iron Tankard â€œOld Stock Aleâ€ is the first of four beers in Terrapinâ€™s Georgia Theatre Sessions. It is brewed with a generous portion of crystal malts for a full body and is lightly hopped. This malt forward beer has flavors of dark dried fruit, mellow alcoholic warmth and is unfiltered for your listening pleasure.

A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Georgia Historic Trust for Historic Preservation Fund to rebuild the Georgia Theater. To make things even more interesting, there is one Golden Ticket hidden among each of the Georgia Theater Sessions brews. This means that four lucky winners will receive a lifetime pass to the new Theater.
