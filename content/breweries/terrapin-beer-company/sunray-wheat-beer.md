The Sunray Wheat is a German-style unfiltered wheat beer brewed with a touch of local Georgia Coast Tupelo honey from the Savannah Bee Company.

Its inviting banana and sweet clove like aroma gives way to a pleasant, clean finish with a hint of tartness.

This beer is available in the Terrapin “All The Hits” Variety 12-pack as well as in individual 6-packs.
