The opaque blackness and beige-colored
foam mousse of Chambly Noire belie its light,
refreshing body and clean, long finish,
featuring hints of roasted coffee beans, toast
and toffee. 

We recommend pairing it with grilled salmon,
steak or tuna au poivre, smoked meats,
coffee-crusted rack of lamb, or chocolate
espresso flan.
