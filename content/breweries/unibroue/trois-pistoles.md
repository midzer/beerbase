Trois Pistoles has a dark brown color topped with a rich foam mousse.
Its slightly sweet taste is enhanced by accents of roasted malt, cocoa, ripe fruit and dark spices with a smooth finish like an old port.

Brewed with four selected malts and four
exotic spices, Trois Pistoles beckons with a
subtle sweetness that makes it surprisingly
smooth and satisfying for a beer of such strength and complexity.
