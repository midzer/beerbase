Don de Dieu displays an appealing orange-golden hue with a stable, creamy head of foam. Its fruity, malty and yeasty flavor is quickly succeeded by a palate-warming finish of roasted nuts and spices.

This smooth, exceptionally strong triple wheat
ale offers a complex flavor that is slightly
fruity, malty, nutty and yeasty, with a hint of 
unfiltered sake.
