The copper-colored body and generous foam
head of this amber ale tantalize the eyes but
it's the complex flavor of Seigneuriale that
delivers a pleasant surprise. It is slightly
sweet, malty and spicy, but a distinctive hop
character and notes of apricot brandy give
Seigneuriale a truly unique character. 

We recommending pairing it with carved ham,
apricot-glazed duck or squab, Thai shrimp
curry or a holiday fruit cake.
