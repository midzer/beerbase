Maudite has a deep amber-red color with a rocky foam head and an appealing aroma of wild spices and floral hop notes.  It is spicy, vinous, and deliciously complex with a crisp hop finish.


The robust maltiness and  spiciness of our
amber-red ale is counterbalanced by an
assertive hop finish, offering a distinctive
flavor that is cognac-like in complexity.
