Topped by a sumptuous head of foam, La Terrible possesses a fruity aroma enriched with notes of roasted malt and Madeira. Its long lasting flavour is both elegant and full bodied.

La Terrible is a dark brown beer on lees and is part of a collection of exotic and refined Unibroue beers brewed using 100% natural raw materials. It may be drunk as an aperitif or as an after dinner digestive. It is equally a perfect accompaniment to the above-mentioned dishes or a pleasant alternative to coffee.
