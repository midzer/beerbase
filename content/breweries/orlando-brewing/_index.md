They have a wide variety of beers made on premises, with more than a dozen on tap. Bar is is in an industrial area and is kinda bare, but it's got good beer, and good people, and that's what counts. Try the 'Monk-in-the-trunk' stay the hell away from the Winter Park beer.  Bottles, and kegs available as well.
