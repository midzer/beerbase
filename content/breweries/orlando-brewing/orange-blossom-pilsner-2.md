When you make a pot of coffee, but only use half the water, you get some pretty rich coffee. That's the approach we took with our latest offering. OBP Squared, with half the water, has 11% alcohol by volume-twice that of original OBP.

The result is a bold, distinct taste of its own. Made with twice as much real orange blossom honey, all-natural ingredients and no refined sugar, it really is the new king bee of beers.
