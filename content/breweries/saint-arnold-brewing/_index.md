Saint Arnold Brewing Company, located in Houston, is Texas' Oldest Craft Brewery. Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.  Our small crew of seventeen does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.
