A refreshing, flavorful filtered wheat beer. The perfect beer to accompany a meal or for a summer's day. The wheat contributes a lighter flavor while maintaining a rich body. The beer has a light hop profile -- just enough to give the beer balance and complexity. The light fruitiness is derived from a KÃ¶lsch yeast strain. A chill haze may be present, which is a characteristic of wheat beers. 

Saint Arnold Texas Wheat is best consumed at 40-45Â° Fahrenheit.
