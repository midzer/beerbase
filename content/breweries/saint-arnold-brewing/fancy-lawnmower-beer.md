A true German-style KÃ¶lsch. Originally brewed in Cologne, this beer is light yet has a sweet malty body that is balanced by a complex, citrus hop character. Multiple additions of German Hallertauer hops are used to achieve this delicate flavor. We use a special KÃ¶lsch yeast, an ale yeast that ferments at lager temperatures, to yield the slightly fruity, clean flavor of this beer. Fancy Lawnmower Beer is a world class brew yet light enough to be enjoyed by Texans after strenuous activities, like mowing the lawn.

Saint Arnold Fancy Lawnmower Beer is best consumed at 35-45Â° Fahrenheit.
