Porter is a dark-coloured beer developed in the 1750s. Porter has a heavier flavour and aroma and a slightly sweet taste. Its name probably originates in the belief that this strong, nourishing drink was ideal for hard-working porters and labourers. Black Creek Porter is wonderful on its own, or with salty snacks.
