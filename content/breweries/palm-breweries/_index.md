Brouwerij Palm is the brewery of the top-fermented beers from Brabant; in the rural settings of Steenhuffel between Antwerp and Brussels. The duchy of Brabant has a tradition of using all the best ingredients nature has to offer. The Brabant draught horse once was Belgium's most important export product. To emphasise how proud they are of their region of Brabant, Brouwerij Palm uses the Brabant draught horse as a logo for its top-fermented beer Special Palm.
