Copper Kettle Brewery is an up and coming brewery owned by Harold Kerlin and Russ Eisenhuth. We have been independently brewing beer for the past 6 years. In 2006 we won First place in the Sam Adams Longshot contest for the northeast region of the U.S. with our Potbelly Porter. After that we decided to start our own brewery. The Brewery is located in just outside of Laurelton PA. We are a small production brewery using a one barrel brewing system. We hope to produce around 50 barrels a year. At present we are making 4 different styles of beer. A Wheat beer, Porter, Grand Cru, and Belgian Dubbel. All of our beer is unfiltered, and bottle conditioned. Our beers are now available at the Bull Run Inn, Market St., Lewisburg, The Beer Barn, Lewisburg and Wehr's Beverages, Mifflinburg.
