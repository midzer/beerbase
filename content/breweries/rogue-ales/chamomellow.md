Chamomellow is an herbal golden ale infused with chamomile, which provides an enticing floral aroma. Chamomile is one of the oldest garden herbs used by ancient Egyptians and other cultures to battle illness, promote calm and relieve anxiety, hence the name Chamomellow. Dedicated to Caleb McLoughlin, a revolutionary brewer who created this elixir at Rogues Issaquah Brewhouse and won a Gold medal in the Herbs & Spice category at the 2003 Great American Beer Festival.

Chamemollow is created from Northwest Harrington and Klages, and Maier Munich Malts (18% speciality grains, .19 lbs grain per bottle). Kent Golding and Cascade hops, and infused with Chamomile. Available in a limited edition 22-ounce bottles (originally as Test Batch 1 - Gold Medal Series), and on draft at Rogues six Public Houses.
