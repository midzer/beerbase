Offering a hop-heads paradise, this unfiltered Northwest-Style India Pale Ale introduces a big floral hop character to the aroma, flavor and finish. Hops, Hops, Hops from front to back but nicely offset with a malty richness that prevents this ale from being overbearing. Tracktown is made from 100% Floor Malted Maris Otter, 100% Northwest Amarillo Hops, Free Range Coastal Water, and absolutely No Chemicals, Additives, or Preservatives.
