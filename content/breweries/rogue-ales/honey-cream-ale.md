Honey Cream Ale is fermented warm like traditional cream ales but features an added twist--wildflower honey from Oregon. Honey imparts a dry, refreshing character to the beer because it ferments almost completely. The honey comes from a beekeeper in Blodgett, a tiny town 20 miles east of Newport.

Rogues Honey Cream Ale is a light, smooth, medium bodied ale, with a creamy head, hints of honey and a crisp light finish. Brewed with two-row Harrington, Klages and Munich malts and Crystal hops. Discontined for distribution in late 2005, available on tap only at Rogue Ales Public Houses.
