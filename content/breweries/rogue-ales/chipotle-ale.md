Dedicated to Spanish author Juan de la Cueva, who, in 1575, wrote of a an dish that combined seedless chipotles with beer: Chipotle Ale is based on Rogues American Amber Ale, but delicately spiced with smoked jalapeno (chipotle) chile peppers. Deep amber in color with a tight head, rich malty aroma, delicately smooth and crisp flavor, and subtle chipotle chili finish. Chipotle Ale is created from Northwest Harrington, Klages, and Maier Munich Malts; Willamette and Cascade hops; and Chipolte (smoked jalapeno) Peppers. Available in a 22-ounce (12/case), 12-ounce (24 loose/case) screened bottles, and on draft. Blend it with Rogue Chocolate Stout and create a Mole black and tan!
