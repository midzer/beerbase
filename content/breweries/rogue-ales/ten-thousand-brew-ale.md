Brew 10,000: One Brewer, Eighteen Years, Ten-Thousand Batches of Beer. 

Brew 10,000 is not so much a style of beer, rather it is a new recipe using some of the best ingredients John Maier has ever brewed with... Vienna, French Special Aroma, and Maris Otter Pale Malts; Yakima Summit and German Saphir Hops, Free-range Coastal Waters, and PacMan Yeast. 

Brew 10,000 was brewed only once, so its allocated and very, very limited. Its packaged in the swing-top 750-ml ceramic bottle and available only at select retailers. Note, Brew 10,000 was sold out at the brewery in early 2007, however, very limited amounts may still available in the retail trade, email Schuyler@rogue.com for a retailer near you.
