Honey Orange Wheat is an unfiltered wheat beer and has flavors of honey and orange balanced with a nice medium-sweet malt character. It is medium bodied with no harsh bitterness and a nice honey-orange finish. It is made from Northwest Two-Row and Wheat Malts; Willamette Hops; #48 Oregon Wildflower Honey, Orange Juice, and Free Range Coastal Waters. It is currently available on draft.
