The Morimoto Soba Ale is part of the new Signature Series of Rogue Ales, launched in the Spring of 2003 with internationally acclaimed Chef Masaharu Morimoto--a James Beard awarded chef and one of the stars of the Food Network series, Iron Chef. 

Soba (also known as buckwheat) is not a type of wheat but a member of the rhubard family (a fruit, not a grain!) Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).

Morimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness. Morimoto Soba Ale is available in a 22 ounce silkscreened bottle and 13.2 gallon sankey kegs.
