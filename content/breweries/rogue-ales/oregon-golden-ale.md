Oregon Golden Ale is the original Rogue brew dating back to 1988 and the days of the old Ashland brewpub location (which was destroyed by a flood several years ago). Deep golden in color with a rich malty aroma. Delicately smooth and crisp flavor and an herbal finish. Oregon Golden Ale is created from Northwest Harrington and Klages, and Maier Munich Malts (18% speciality grains, .19 lbs grain per bottle). Kent Golding and Cascade hops. Oregon Golden Ale is available in a 22-ounce bottle (the 12-ounce 6-pack was phased out in early 2005), and on draft.
