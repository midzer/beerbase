Yellow Snow IPA was originally introduced for the 2000 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

Yellow Snow is Rogueâ€™s tribute to winter sports everywhereâ€”downhill skiing, snowboarding, cross country, ice hockey, ice fishing, snowmobiling, and even curling. 

It will be available November 1st in select states where mountains and snow can be found.

Pale golden in color with a hoppy fruity aroma. Big hop flavor up front complemented by medium body and hoppyness mid-pallet. Finishes with a characteristic lingering bitterness.
