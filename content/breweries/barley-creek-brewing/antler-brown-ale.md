This traditional American style brown ale has medium body with a sweet Carastan maltiness. A rich deep chocolate color, our Antler Brown Ale is mildly hopped with Mt. Hood hops. Check out the Antler tap handle... locally grown! This has been our most popular beer over the years... a very easy drinking brew.
