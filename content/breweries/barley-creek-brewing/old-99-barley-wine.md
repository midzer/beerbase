First brewed in 1998 to be served on our fifth anniversary (December 15, 1999), this beer just gets better every year. And, every year around our anniversary, we brew a new vintage. With an original gravity of 1099, this Barley Wine is dark and sweet, and is served in a snifter like an after-dinner drink. You'll want to savor it slowly.
