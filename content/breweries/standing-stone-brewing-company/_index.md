Ashland's only full service brewpub is housed in an historic building with a light industrial character. We offer our own freshly brewed handcrafted ales and lagers, including seasonal and other specialty brews.  All Standing Stone Ales are made here at the brewery in ten barrel batches using over 80% organic malts.
