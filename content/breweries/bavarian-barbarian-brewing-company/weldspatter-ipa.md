Weldspatter IPA is not your typical India Pale Ale. First of all, it isn’t as aggressively hopped as many other American versions. Second, it isn’t quite as pale. Balance is a lovely thing in beers and Weldspatter IPA achieves balance without compromising hop presence. The hop flavor and aroma abound, but the bitterness is held in check to give our IPA a pleasant malt character as well.
