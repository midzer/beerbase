Hammerin’ Ale is the Barbarian’s first beer. Brewed to be a well-balanced, easy-going beer, Hammerin’ Ale comes from a rather simple recipe which yields a deep amber color and a sublime balance of malt character and hop flavors. This beer goes very well with grilled meats and is meant to be enjoyed year-round. Hammerin’ Ale is an excellent choice for “Barbarians” who are new to craft beer.
