Hammerinâ€™ Ale is the Barbarianâ€™s first beer. Brewed to be a well-balanced, easy-going beer, Hammerinâ€™ Ale comes from a rather simple recipe which yields a deep amber color and a sublime balance of malt character and hop flavors. This beer goes very well with grilled meats and is meant to be enjoyed year-round. Hammerinâ€™ Ale is an excellent choice for â€œBarbariansâ€� who are new to craft beer.
