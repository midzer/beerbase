Headbangerz Brown Ale is based on an English brown ale style. Its color is a demonic, dark reddish-brown. This beer is subtly sweet and punctuated with roasty, nutty flavors. The hops take a back seat and simply complement the malt character.  Headbangerz Brown Ale is perfect for any Autumn outdoor activities or for relaxing on Summer evenings. Headbangerz Brown Ale is named in honor of Barbarian Chief's, Mike Hiller, hardworking former co-workers â€“ heavy metal freaks and masters of metal fabrication.
