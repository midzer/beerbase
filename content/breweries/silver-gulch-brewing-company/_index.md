Silver Gulch Brewing and Bottling Co. has been in operation since February 1998 in the small mining community of Fox, Alaska, located about 10 miles north of Fairbanks on the Steese Highway. Silver Gulch Brewing grew from brewmaster Glenn Brady's home-brewing efforts in 5-gallon batches to its current capacity of 24-barrel (750 gallon) batches.
