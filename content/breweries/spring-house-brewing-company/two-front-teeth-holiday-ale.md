We welcome the release of â€œTwo Front Teeth Holiday Aleâ€ a Belgian style Saison with subtle real cherry flavoring.  What a good way to drown out in-laws by enjoying a pint or two of this recent release from Spring House Brewing Company.  This is not for the faint palate; this holiday offering is coming in at 9.4% ABV!  We hope you stop by for a taste or a Growler fill but unfortunately you have to stop in for this one.  Enjoy!
