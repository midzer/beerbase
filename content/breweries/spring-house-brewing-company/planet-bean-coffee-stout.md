Brewed to give the stout a smoother, almost slick, mouthfeel with a nice finish of coffee provided by Cumberland Coffee and Tea Company. Dark malts are used to give this beer a very complex roast flavor. Lower bittering rates ~30 IBUâ€™s helps put the flavor highlighting the maltiness, and roasted malt. ABV is coming in around 7% on this one!
