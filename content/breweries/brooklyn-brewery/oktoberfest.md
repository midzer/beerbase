Please enjoy Brooklyn Oktoberfest, a rich, malty version of the beer brewed for the fall festival which originated in Germany with the betrothal of the Crown Prince of Bavaria in 1810. Brooklyn Oktoberfest is in the marzen style, an amber lager beer brewed in March and stored cold through the summer for sale in autumn.
