The Mighty Fish Brewers first produced Ten Squared Anniversary Ale to celebrate Fish Brewing Companyâ€™s tenth anniversary. The ale was so good and the response to it so overwhelmingly positive that it has become the crown jewel of REEL ALEs. Ten different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed. 

Even with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey. Produced for the holidays, 10 102 Anniversary Ale is usually available into late spring.
