Carlow Brewing Company is a small Irish Brewery established in 1998.  Carlow, a small town located in the Barrow Valley Region, the traditional malt and hop producing region in Ireland, once boasted a number of breweries, but the practice had been discontinued for over 100 years until revived in 1998 by Carlow Brewing Company.
