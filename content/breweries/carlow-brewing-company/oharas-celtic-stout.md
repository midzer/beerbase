Unlike the image, does not have the creamy head like many Irish stouts (Beamish, Guinness, Murphys) and as a result lighter on the stomach and nice with a meal. Very distinctive taste which may put off those not accustomed to drinking stouts.I would recommend it for the more adventurous pallette.

Roast barley comes through in the taste.
