A traditional German-style lager, fermented at 7-9°C and lagered at 4°C for 4-6 weeks. The storage produces a soft, natural carbonation. Full-bodied with high bitterness and hop flavour and a dry finish. Hoppy aromatic nose. Available on draught or in 780 mL champagne-style bottles. Can be difficult to acquire.
