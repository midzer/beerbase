A light copper body low bitterness with good hop flavor. This is my impression of what the English troops may have been drinking when they occupied India. The pale ale they drank had mellowed considerably. The wooden casks had spent many months traveling on ships and long inland journeys to the troops, where they were then tapped and enjoyed.
