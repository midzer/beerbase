This beer truly defies style. A portion of the fermentable sugars that make up this beer come from beet sugar. Real beet extract is used which gives the beer a beautiful light red color. Itâ€™s body is inviting and the taste is smooth. Hops are barely perceivable and are there to balance out the sweetness from the malt.
