Our Holiday Offering
In pre-christian times, the Celebration of darkness and light was marked with great halls filled with smoke & mirrors. Guilded goblets brimming with seasonal brews were lifted to lips, speaking a language no longer known. 
Centuries pass.

The winter wind finds its way through heavy wood doors. There is a solemn business of monks to be done. But also brewing, a season of celebration is about to begin....
More years pass.
The modern age. 
The present connects the past through the brewer's art and a new beer is born.
Feast of Fools... 
A perfect dessert beer brewed exclusively for the holiday season.  Hand bottled, champagne corked. 
Our inky, rich, black stout, with the addition of raspberries.
