An ale for dancing bonfires and falling leaves.
Jinx prepares the bones for snow. It's a full bodied strong ale the color of maple's golden leaves in the season's fading sun.  Finished with a touch of peat-smoked whiskey malt, Jinx offers sweet, toasty aromas of caramel, tea, and smoke.  Deep flavors of dark candy sugar and warming alcohol notes are balanced by a spicy hop bitterness.
