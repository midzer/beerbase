Our Vermont Imperial Stout
Past the dark and into the deep lies this stout and hearty hale ale from a far off forsaken age. Black like shimmering shades of furthest night, this ale will warm your cold limbs and light your mind's fire.

Thumbsucker(tm), big full-bodied, dark beer with a rich, roasted malt flavor and balanced by an assertive hop bitterness, is our salute to the rarest Imperial Stouts of lore.
