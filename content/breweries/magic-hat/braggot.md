An Ale Brewed with Honey
Our inaugural Epic Elixir, Braggot is a most remarkable honey ale, made with specialty malts & wildflower honey from Vermont's Champlain Valley. The honey adds smoothness with subtle hints of chamomile.

Braggot is an ale of shining perfection that simply must be experienced to be understood. But hurry ... for Braggot, as with each entry in our Humdinger series, vanishes almost as soon as it arrives.  Get a bottle of Braggot today and come to know a new 'Ale of Legend'. 

Wild Flower Honey, primarily Red Clover and Alfalfa from Champlain Valley Apiaries in Middlebury, Vermont. This represents 50% of the total fermentable sugars.

Chamomile: Whole Chamomile flowers steeped in hot wort.
