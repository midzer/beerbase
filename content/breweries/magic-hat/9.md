Not quite pale ale.  A beer cloaked in secrecy.  An ale whose mysterious unusual palate will swirl across your tongue and ask more questions than it answers.

A sort of dry, crisp, fruity, refreshing, not-quite pale ale.  #9 is really impossible to describe because there's never been anything else quite like it.  Our secret ingredient introduces a most unusual aroma which is balanced with residual sweetness.
