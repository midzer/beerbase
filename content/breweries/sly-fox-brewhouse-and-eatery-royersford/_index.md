A full production brewery and accompanying restaurant opened in 2004 by the owners of Sly Fox Brewhouse & Eatery in nearby Phoenixville. The 20bbl brewhouse packages a wide range of beers in 12oz cans, 22oz bottles and 750ml bottles. Pikeland Pils, a multiple GABF Gold Medal Winner, and O'Reilly's Stout, a nitro-poured, draught-only beer named after brewer Brian O'Reilly's grandfather are among its most popular beers, on and off premises, as are such Belgian-style delights as Incubus Tripel, Ichor Quadrupel, Saison Vos & Black Raspberry Reserve. Sly Fox is also noted for its Bock Beers (see listing for the Phoenixville pub for more details) and annual Christmas Ale.
