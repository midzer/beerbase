In the old days, runners who made it to third base were rewarded with a mug of beer! This is the way the game was meant to be played; pitchers throwing side- armed and a half barrel on the field. Our Red Legg Ale is an American Amber Ale with a rich, malty flavor, slightly sweet on the finish. An All-Star in any line- up!
