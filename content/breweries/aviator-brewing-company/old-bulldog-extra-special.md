A hearty extra special beer or basically a pale ale on steroids.  A dark amber beer with a rich blend of  malts.  The base malt is full kilned pale 2-row barley and is combined with full tasting crystal malt.  This beer has a great heavy late hop addition of East Kent Goldings (that cost us our lunch money for weeks...). ALWAYS AVAILABLE or at least we try.
