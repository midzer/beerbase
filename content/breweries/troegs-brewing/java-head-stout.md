We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown, PA to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating an environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Java Head a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus aromas from the combination of Kenyan beans and whole flower hops.
