Revisiting Scratch #3, we take the same Tripel recipe, add beet and cane sugars to the kettle, and run the wort through our hopback brimming with juniper berries, coriander and yarrow flowers.

Inspired by the herbaceous nose of gin, the berries and flowers give a slight pine/citrus aroma with floral undertones. Scratch #8 has a dry, yeasty finish and noticeable alcohol warming when consumed.
