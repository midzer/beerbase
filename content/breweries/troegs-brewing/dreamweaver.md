Long toasty days, cool breezy nights and a splash of magic provide the inspiration for the Troegs brothers’ dreamiest Single Batch creation—Dreamweaver Wheat. Combining four wheat types with Munich and Pils malts, noble Saaz hops, and a yeast strain that imparts a spicy, peppery, clove taste with a slight hint of bananas, Dreamweaver Wheat is an unfiltered blast of spicy, mouthwatering joy.
