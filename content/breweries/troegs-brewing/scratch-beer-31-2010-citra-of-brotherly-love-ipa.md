Scratch 31, the brothers and the brewers decided to revisit one of our favorite sweet spots â€“ IPA â€“ and have some fun with hop flavors. Dubbed â€˜Citra of Brotherly Loveâ€™ in honor of Philly Beer week, Scratch #31 has generous amounts of Apollo, Cascade and Citra hops. This is our first use of Citra hops, which is known for an intense grapefruit aroma and flavor.

While showcasing the intense Citra flavor we added additional bitterness with Apollo and Chinook hops as well. Scratch #31 went through a bed of Chinook hops in the hopback and was dry-hopped with Cascade and Citra hops.
