We started with the same grain bill as Scratch #12 (IPA) and substituted 25% rye for the base malt giving Scratch #18 a creamy mouth feel and a full-bodied taste.

Mount Hood and Chinook hops are combined here for flavoring and aroma, and Warrior hops are used for overall bitterness.

The rye plays off the Mount Hood hops, with both ingredients releasing an herbal, spicy flavor. Cheers.
