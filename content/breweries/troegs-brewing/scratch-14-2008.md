Scratch #14-2008 is our interpretation of a farmhouse aleâ€”a once near-extinct winter-brewed (and summerâ€“imbibed) Belgian ale.

Our celebratory brew starts with a black pepper and ginger nose. The nicely carbonated brew releases a honey-malt flavor that gives way to a tart crisp finish that masks the elevated ABV.

We use a blended yeast strain (Saison Dupont & Le Chouffe) to create the traditional peppery, spicy earthy flavors of the saison. Slight hints of ginger also come through in the finish.

Drink it â€˜til the wedding bells chime!
