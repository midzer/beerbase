Old world brewing techniques combine with Noble hops for Scratch #6-2007.
This Export Lager features a single stage decoctionâ€”a first for TrÃ¶egs Brewery. After combining barley and water we transfer a portion of the mash to the brew kettle for a quick boil. The heated mash is then returned to the mash kettle and the brewing process continues. This process deepens the malt character and adds a subtle toffee backbone to this delicious lager.

Weâ€™ve added Magnum hops for bittering and Czech Saaz hops for aroma to create a classic European Noble hop flavor. 

Scratch #6-2007 is unfiltered, so there will be a slight haze to the beer.
