Scratch #16-2008 combines the bitterness of two aroma hops, the lush sweetness of honey and malt and an earthly yeast taste creating a Winter Warmer designed to ward off the coldest days.

The dark, rich amber color comes from a combination of molasses and crystal malts; the Thames Valley brings a distinct earthly flavor; white the blend of hops creates fruity (Amarillo) and piney (Cluster) bitterness.

The Winter Warmer ends with a slight warming sensation from the elevated alcohol content.  Enjoy this one throughout the winter months.  Cheers.
