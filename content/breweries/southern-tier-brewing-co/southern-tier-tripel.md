Don't let Tripel's light color and delicate aroma fool you, this is one serious beer brewed with maximum effort.  First, we introduce the freshest barley to crystal filtered water.  Second, we add the best hops shipped directly from Europe.  Third, our special yeast is the catalyst for fermentations, gobbling sugar and creating alcohol as it works.  

Some say that the Belgian monks who first brewed this style called it triple to denote it's high alcohol content.  Still others believe triple's origins lay in its triple fermentations; twice in the brewery and once in the bottle.  Whatever the answer, ours is the Tripel threat.
