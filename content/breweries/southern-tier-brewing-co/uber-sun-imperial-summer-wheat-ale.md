It is through the movement of the universe that life presents itself in transformation. It is in this spirit that we make ÜberSun, a tribute to the dynamic energy of summer. The alignment of wheat and barley through this hop-infused brew embodies the solar system itself... This may be a difficult task, but one our brewers revel in! They brew a galaxy of taste into every batch. ÜberSun is the ultimate experience that will challenge you with each sip. ÜberSun Imperial Summer Wheat Beer takes off where our Hop Sun finishes. Like it’s little brother, ÜberSun is clean and full of flavor, but don’t pull an Icarus– this is one big beer! Pour a glass or drink straight from the bottle, it’s meant to be consumed wisely with friends between summer solstice and autumnal equniox.
