The hexagram talisman has been used around the world for centuries to invoke magic and good luck. The sixâ€“point star is also the customary symbol of the brewer, representing the essential aspects of purity: water, hops, grain, malt, yeast, and of course, the brewer. Wishes of good fortune often collaborate with the brewerâ€™s creativity to yield dramatic results. We carefully chose the name for this Imperial India Black Ale, Iniquity â€“ a word opposing goodness. Why? This beer is contrary to what one may expect from an IPA; this is an ale as black as night. It is the antithesis of Unearthly. Some may consider it an immoral act to blacken an ale. We suggest they donâ€™t rely on conventional standards. Allow the darkness to consume you. Cheers!
