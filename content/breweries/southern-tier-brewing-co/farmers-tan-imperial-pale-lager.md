Neolithic humans evolved from nomadic hunters into a more settled agricultural society, changing life forever. The â€˜founderâ€™ crops they raised included wheat and barley. It is little surprise that the first examples of brewing appeared during this age.

Brewers owe much to the epoch. Similarly, we thank our farmer friends of today for cultivating the ingredients the are responsible for the beers we now enjoy. Their laborious days spent ourdoors under the hot sun earn them respect, as well as a mark of distinction: the farmer's tan. Yes, the inevitable red and white hallmark of hard work.
