The discovery of the true I.P.A. (India Pale Ale) made right here in Slippery Rock. The British added hops to oak barrels to help preserve the beer for its long voyage to British-controlled India. Brewed in this same English tradition, we dry-hopped our ale, giving the beer a very aromatic quality as it travels to your mug.
