Storm Brewing thundered onto the market in June of 1995 with a brilliantly balanced ale called Red Sky Alt which was reminiscent of the great German Alt Biers of the Golden Years of European brewing. The instant success of Red Sky quickly established the reputation of Brewmaster and owner, James Walton. He is perceived as an innovator and as a stickler for quality by both the media and the trade. Recent expert evaluation rated Storm Brewing's Hurricane I.P.A. among the best in the whole of Canada.
