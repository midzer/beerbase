Brewery Vivant is the realization of years of dreaming and much discussion of what a great brewery can be. What makes our brewery different from the rest is the way we approach our craft and operate our business. The core of Brewery Vivant can be found at the crossroads of three passions:

   1. Our love of the tradition and artistic approach of the Belgian & French styles of beers
   2. Devotion to using local sources for ingredients and running our business according to the three pillars of sustainability; Environmental Integrity, Social Equity, and Economic Viability
   3. Sharing the experience of how beer and food can be paired to uplift the enjoyment of both
