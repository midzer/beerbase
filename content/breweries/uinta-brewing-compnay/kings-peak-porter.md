King's Peak Porter is deep mahogany in color and has a full-bodied malty flavor. Hints of chocolate malt are easily detectable.

Topped with a tan creamy head, this beer has a definite hop character that nicely balances its mild bitterness. 

King's Peak is the highest point in the state of Utah at 13,528 feet, located in northeastern Utah in the Uinta Mountains.
