The Winter seasonal from Adnams, Fisherman is described as an old ale. If your local pub has the good sense to serve cask beer, look for Fisherman on draught from January through March.

Clean and refreshing yet dark and mysterious, Fisherman is a deep coppery red, conjuring roasted nuts and dark chocolate, with a lingering taste of liquorice and dried fruits.
