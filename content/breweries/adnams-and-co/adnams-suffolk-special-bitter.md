Adnams Suffolk Special Bitter, at 4.5% alcohol by volume, is a dry, crisp, refreshing, and distinctly hoppy example of its style.

This beer is also available in some markets in tradtional cask form, as Adnams Bitter. At only 3.7% alcohol, Adnams Bitter is the classic English 'ordinary,' though we think you'll agree that there's full of flavor.

Despite its rich heritage and enduring fame, Adnams is not a company willing to rest on its laurels. Its continued commitment to quality and innovative packaging designs has made it Britainâ€™s fastest growing brewery over the last two years. To top it off, Adnamsâ€™ head brewer was recently chosen as Britainâ€™s Brewer of the Year by a panel of his peers.
