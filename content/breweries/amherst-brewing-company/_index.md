Amherst Brewing Company is a full-service brewpub located in downtown Amherst, Massachusetts. Our 10-Barrel brewery is visible from the bar and produces some of the finest ales and lagers for serving in our 150-seat restaurant and 100-seat lounge and game room. Brewery tours can be made by appointment. Our giant, brass-top bar seats over 30 people and is fully stocked, including Single Malt Scotches and Small Batch Bourbons. An additional 40 seats are available on our seasonal patio; the best place in town to relax and enjoy an ABC draft or specialty brew while watching passersby. --From Amherst Website
