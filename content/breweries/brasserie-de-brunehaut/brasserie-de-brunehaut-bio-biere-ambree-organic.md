Amber copper color with a beige head.
Caramel malt aromas reminiscent of vanilla, along with toffee, butterscotch and ripe fruits. Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.
Hazy amber to brown coloured beer, with a fluffy off-white head. Nice aroma of spices, yeast and oak.  The alcohol subtle. Flavour is moderately spicy and slightly fruity, with balanced hops. 
This beer is certified organic.
