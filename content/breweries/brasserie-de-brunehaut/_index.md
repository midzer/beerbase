An artisanal (non-conglomerate) brewer, Brunehaut employs ancient Belgian brewing recipes, dating from the First Crusade and documented from 1096. Combining top (in-bottle) fermentation with modern production technologies, Brunehaut's signature ales include Dubble and Tripel bottle-conditioned ales, consistent with 1500+-year-old Belgian brewing traditions. Three bio (organic) beers, distributed under the Brunehaut label, use organic gains, grown by the brewers, within ten kilometers of the brewhaus.
