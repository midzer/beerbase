A classic Belgian blonde ale from the Hainaut region in the southwest Belgium, near the French border. Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.
This organic blonde ale presents a nice yeasty nose, long-lasting head and a spicy, earthy note on the palate.
