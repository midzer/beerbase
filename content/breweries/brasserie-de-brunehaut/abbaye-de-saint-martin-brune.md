Abbaye Saint-Martin Brune was named World's Best Abbey (Dark) Beer @ the 2009 World Beer Awards (London). Aroma of caramel and liquorice.  Less sweet than most traditional Dark Abbey Ales. Many people prefer this double at room temperature. It is especially popular when paired with dessert.
Abbye St. Martin Ales are pure Belgium.
