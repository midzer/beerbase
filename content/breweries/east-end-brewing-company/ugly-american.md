THE UGLY AMERICAN is a perfectly enjoyable classic Belgian Trippel corrupted almost beyond recognition with a completely inappropriate amount of US hops. Only in America can such excessive excesses be fully appreciated, celebrated, and enjoyed...and for now, only at East End Brewing! To make this one a little more cellar-able, and a lot more portable, it's going into the bottle.
