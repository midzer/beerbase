The sun barely breaks the horizon, the arctic winds bite, and snow blankets the land. It’s winter in Wisconsin! Throughout the area, you’ll find armies of fisherman, clad in blaze orange parkas and snowmobile suits, dragging their crudely built ice shanties onto the frozen lakes. While they vary in size, shape and color, each shanty contains an enthusiast braving the cold; spinning their tall tales; staring deeply into that hole in the ice; and, of course, enjoying a Legendary Wisconsin Beer. Brewed in the fall to help you survive our Wisconsin winters.

Shantytown Doppelbock is brewed in the style of a German Doppelbock. Brown in color with malty sweetness and a full body.
