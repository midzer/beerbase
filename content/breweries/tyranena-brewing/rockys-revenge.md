Deep in the darkest depths of Rock Lake prowls a great saurian known today as Rocky.  The legend of Rocky is old.  The ancient inhabitants of Aztalan warned of the beast by building a giant serpent mound at the lake’s edge.  The early residents of Lake Mills were forewarned of a guardian placed in the lake to protect its sacred stone tepees.  And history tells of numerous encounters with Rocky, who became a source of great worry and fear.  Although not seen for over a century, divers still experience a feeling of dread and being watched.  Enjoy Rocky’s Revenge, our offering to this legendary protector of Tyranena.

Rocky’s Revenge is an American brown ale with a portion aged in bourbon barrels.  Each bourbon barrel will contribute its own unique character to this rich, satisfying ale.
