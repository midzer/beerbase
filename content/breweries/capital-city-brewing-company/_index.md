Washington DC's first brewpub since prohibition, Capitol City Brewing Co. opened its doors in 1992. Our first location still stands in Downtown DC, at 11th and H St., NW. Our company policy is to bring the fine craft of brewing to every person who lives and visits our region, as well as treating them to a wonderful meal and a great experience.
