A deep copper coloured traditional Irish Ale with highly developed and complex flavours. St Patrickâ€™s Ale/Dark is brewed with four malts and two hops, carefully married together to complement eachother producing a satisfying full flavour, ending with a Styrian late hop for a truly brilliant finish.
