Besides the goldenblond ale, a darker version of the townbeer has been created : Brugse Zot double, with 7,5 % Vol alc. It is brewed with 6 special kinds of malt, which give the beer a rich taste. The worldly renowned Tcheque Saaz hop from Zatec has been chosen to give the beer this unique bitter note. Brugse Zot double is a fill and stronger beer, highly appreciated by the beerlovers.
