The long-awaited arrival of our Belgian-style Tripel is upon us. Named after the mythical Greek three-headed dog that guards the gates of hell, Kerberos is a traditional Belgian-style Tripel with a dark golden color has a sweet flavor with a dry and spicy finish. This nectar of the Gods is deceptively strong at 8.5% and is bottle conditioned for an authentic flavor.
