A ruby-red raspberry beer with a luscious, pink head

Our Frambozen is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with raspberries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Fraser Valley raspberries. The result is a ruby-red fruit beer with a intense raspberry flavour, a nice tart finish and a luscious pink head.
