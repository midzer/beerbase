While ales are fermented for relatively short periods of time at room temperature, lagers employ a special variety of yeast and much cooler fermentation temperatures to achieve their truly clean, dry flavour profile. Our Lion's Gate Lager has a light body, a very crisp palate and a soft, hop finish, which is imparted by the exquisitely gentle Czech Saaz hop variety. The Lions would approve.
