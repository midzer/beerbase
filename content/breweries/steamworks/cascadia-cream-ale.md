Every year in Vancouver there are a few days when the air is cool & crisp, the sun shines brightly, and the leaves show their vibrant colours -- then it starts to rain incessantly. Anyway, our Cascadia Cream Ale is dedicated to the spirit of mountains, oceans, golden days and gentle mist. Caramel and honey malts lend this ale a mellow, grainy maltiness which is balanced by the subtle presence of English finishing hops. Cheers, our Cascadia Cream Ale will be sure to brighten up even the wettest West Coast day.
