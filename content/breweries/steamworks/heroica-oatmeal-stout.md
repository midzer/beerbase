There are some things in life that require a certain sense of bravado: these might include ordering a quadruple espresso, deciding to sleep without a nightlight, or choosing to live in a region of the continent that is gradually sinking into the Pacific Ocean. If you're no longer scared of the dark, then there's no reason to be afraid of our stout. A generous portion of rolled oats and lots of black roasted barley give this beer a warm, roasted nose, and a distinct dryness that succumbs to waves of lingering satisfaction.
