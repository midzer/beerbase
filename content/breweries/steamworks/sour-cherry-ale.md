An intriguing fruit beer brewed with fresh sour cherries.

Our Sour Cherry Ale is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with cherries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Montmorency cherries from a local orchard in the Fraser Valley. The result is a most intriguing beer with an elegant cherry perfume, a tart, fruity flavour, and a subtle almondy finish.
