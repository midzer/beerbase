Our regulars have many reasons for frequenting our premises. Some come for the comfy chairs, a game of pool, or to exude some seriously suaveness at the oyster bar on a Friday evening. For the truly devoted, however, who come in search of truth, it's the Nut Brown they're after. Often they arrive with a glazed look in their eyes, having endured days of office drudgery or the unknowable hardships of securing a parking spot. Set your cares aside, for all can find solace in this ale's yin-yang of nutty maltiness and delicate, dryish hoppiness. For our Nut Brown, an ale deep auburn in colour, we use a blend of Munich, caramel and chocolate malts to create a rich malty palate with a lingering dry chocolatiness.
