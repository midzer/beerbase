As you look out over Vancouver's Coal Harbour, relax with this creamy delight. Don't let the colour fool you - this porter is rich but not overpowering with a head that lingers all the way down the glass. Just about anything goes with our Coal Porter, and you don't have to belong to \High Society\" to enjoy a glass with oysters."
