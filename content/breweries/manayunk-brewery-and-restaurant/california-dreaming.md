Imperial, or super IPAâ€™s were spawned out of the fascination of hops by the American consumer and are beyond Pale Ales and IPAâ€™S in terms of both hop and alcohol content. Our interpretation is orange-gold in color, lightly bitter but highly hoppy with a firm malt backbone. 
Weâ€™ll gladly put this head-to-head with the best that those California Hophead/Brewers have to offer.
