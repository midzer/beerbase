A well-balanced, hoppy American style pale ale with a generous usage of Caramel and Crystal malts. This beer is amber in color and is finished
with fresh Cascade, Columbus and Mt. Hood hops from the Pacific Northwest for a wonderful floral aroma. World Beer Cup Bronze Medal winner and a Perennial favorite here at the Brewery. Also available in bottles to go.
