If malt and hops are the two poles of brewing, this beer is the gently spinning sweet spot between them. First, you’ll notice the spicy aromas of Perle and Hallertau hops. Then - wipe the foam off the tip of your nose - dive into the toasty flavors of Vienna and Munich malts. Dynamo starts strong and finishes crisp and smooth. The balanced flavors, aromas, and even the coppery-red tones of this beer go great with everything. Fear no pairing. The best time to enjoy Dynamo is when you’re thirsty.

Dynamo Copper Lager goes great with pizza, neighborhood block parties, spring rolls, first dates, football games, whiskey, tapas, the Sunday newspaper, late-night burritos, veggie omelets, business lunches, grilled mushrooms, pretzels, political debate, corn-on-the-cob, classic sci-fi flicks, mixed greens, campfires, salmon, billiards, cherry pie, rock shows, pumpernickel, salsa, grand openings, peanuts, sewing bees, extra sharp cheddar cheese, and holidays.
