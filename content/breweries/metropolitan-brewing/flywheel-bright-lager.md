The kinetic beauty of spicy hops grabs you by the nose and lets you know: this is German-inspired beer. A mild, bready malt sweetness greets you at the lips, smoothing the crisp hop flavors. Flywheel is meant for bombastic celebrations of singing voices and clamoring mugs. But then, that first contented moment of happy hour is uniquely celebratory as well.

Flywheel Bright Lager goes great with hot dogs, guitar jams, stir fry, bowling, taco salad, house warmings, baked potatoes, Saturday morning cartoons, tequila, gouda cheese, karaoke, bagel & schmear, Euchre, fresh berries, asparagus, 16-inch softball, sushi, darts, Pad Thai, family reunions, pb&j, flan, romantic weekend getaways, garlic bread, pay raises, nachos, baby showers, fondue, and Frisbee golf.
