Bube's Brewery is located within the original brewery's icehouse. The mash/lauter tun and kettle have a 3.5 bbl capacity (approximately 110 gallons.) The brewers usually brew two consecutive batches to meet the capacity of the 10 bbl fermenters. In the brewery there are two 10 bbl fermenters and one 10 bbl conditioning tank for lagered beer.
