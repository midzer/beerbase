Blue Point Brewing's Pale Ale has a light golden color but explodes with a rich full-flavor. This refreshing ale is top-fermented and hopped at four different stages of the brewing process. English pale malt lends complexity to this brew. Small amounts of Wheat and Carapils round out the malt bill. Brewed to satisfy the hop lover, this pale ale has an immediate floral-citrus flavor that pervades the overall character of this hoppy, quenching microbrew.
