Brewery folklore tells a story about a train engineer with a passion for the taste of Railbender Ale. With every stop he made in Erie came an equal number of stops at our brewery. One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports. In tribute to this folklore our expert brewers introduce Derailed Black Cherry Ale â€“ brewed with fresh sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale. Please enjoy responsibly, as we would never want you to get derailed!
