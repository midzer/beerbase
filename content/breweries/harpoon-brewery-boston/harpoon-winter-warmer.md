Winter Warmer was Harpoonâ€™s first seasonal beer.  It was designed to be enjoyed during the holiday season. 

When you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon.  There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent.  The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts.  These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich.  Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice.  The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor. 

The overall character is a smooth, medium bodied ale spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg
