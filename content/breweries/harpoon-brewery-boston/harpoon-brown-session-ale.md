Harpoon Brown is brewed to accentuate the sweeter, rounder notes derived from six different malts, including a de-husked chocolate malt that adds a hint of chocolate. The blend of these malts produces a beer that is complex and delicious without being heavy. This drinkable beer is perfect as a session beer or paired with foods.

This is the first year-round Harpoon beer the brewery has released in almost a decade.  While the craft beer industry has seen a growing trend in \extreme\" beers
