We officially opened on May 5th 2006. Now we will be able to make up to 5000 barrels of beer enabling you more chances to drink your favorite Port Brewed beers at home and around town. More impressive is our oak barrel room where we age our barrel aged specialty beers. Come check out our tasting bar on Fridays and Saturdays where you can get bottles, jugs & merchandise to go while you sample what we've been brewing!
