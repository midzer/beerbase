A Double IPA brewed in memory of the brew cat.  In honor of Mongo, Mike Rodriguez made his first Double IPA, as he loved the cat and wanted to honor him with this beer. This 8.5% abv beer was made with Columbus hops (Mongoâ€™s Birthname), Cascade for the Mama cat, and Simocoe because that is Mikeâ€™s favorite hop.
