Because everyone needs a friend.  It seems only natural that with San Diego being one of the closest cities to the Mexican Border that you would find a beer like Amigo.  Brewed in the San Diego Lager style, this all malt lager is a refreshing way to start or finish a drinking session.  The product of a true lager fermentation, this beer is crisp and lighter in body than most ales of similar strength making it a friendly choice for any occasion.
