St. Bridget, a legendary Irish saint, created a sensation by turning her bathwater into beer. What better way to celebrate her worthy miracle than with our zymurgistic tribute to her feat: St. Bridgetâ€™s Porter. St. Bridgetâ€™s is a smooth and elegant brown porter. Brimming with coffee and chocolate characteristics from dark barley malts, St. Bridgetâ€™s is carefully hopped to provide the perfect complement to its malty robustness. This beer is a â€œmust haveâ€ beer for all porter lovers.
