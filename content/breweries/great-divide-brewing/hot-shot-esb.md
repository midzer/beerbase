HotShot ESB is an easy-drinking and remarkably smooth Extra Special Bitter, brewed in the classic-English style. More assertively hopped than ordinary bitters, light copper-colored HotShot showcases clean hop flavors, balanced by its slightly fruity nose and light-caramel malt character.

While HotShot is one of Great Divideâ€™s easiest-drinking and lower alcohol beers, its complex flavor profile makes it the perfect session beer for craft beer lovers.
