Our homage to the beers that have quenched the thirst of Belgian farm workers for centuries. Brewed with barley, wheat and rice and fermented at high temperatures with a special blend of four different yeast strains, Saison is fruity and slightly tart, with a dry finish that makes it that rarest of treatsâ€“a beer as refreshing as it is complex.
