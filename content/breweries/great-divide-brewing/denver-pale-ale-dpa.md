Historically Great Divideâ€™s flagship beer, DPAâ€™s record speaks for itself. By continually garnering national and international recognition, DPA has risen to become one of the most award-winning English-style pale ales in the world.

Sporting a brilliant copper hue and an assertive floral hop aroma, DPA is known for its smooth, malty middle, which is expertly complemented with hearty and complex hop flavor. DPAâ€™s extraordinary hop finish is marked by crisp yet moderate hop bitterness. Its well-balanced profile makes DPA the perfect beer to accompany a hearty mountain picnic or a night on the town. For those who seek beers characterized by excitement, flavor and distinction, Denver Pale Ale is the natural choice.
