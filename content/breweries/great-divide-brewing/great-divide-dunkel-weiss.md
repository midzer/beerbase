Think of it as a hefeweizenâ€™s older brother. A hearty mix of wheat and dark German barley malts gives it a medium body and muddy brown hue, while our proprietary yeast strain provides the signature notes of banana and clove. If you like wheat beers, come to the Dunkel side. You wonâ€™t be disappointed. Just donâ€™t put any lemon in it.
