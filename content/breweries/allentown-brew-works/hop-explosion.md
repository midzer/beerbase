Hoppiest Brew Works beer ever? The smell of grapefruit, a sweet malt flavor, and oh by the way, lots of hop bitterness. Brewed in the tradition of West Coast ales, we have put loads of malt and hops in our kettle to come up with this sensational ale. Brewed with pale, and crystal malts, hopped with Tomahawks for Yakima Valley, WA. This beer styled has made many a microbrewery famous and this one is sure to please all those who love hops.
