The Allentown Brew Works is housed inside the historic Harold's Furniture Building at 812 W Hamilton Street. Years in the making, the new Allentown restaurant and brewery are part of the continuing vision of the Fegley family that established the original Bethlehem Brew Works in 1998. Proud to be part of the resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in this Queen City. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state of the art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge ï¿½ Silk.
