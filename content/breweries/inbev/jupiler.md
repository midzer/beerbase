Jupiler is the most famous and most popular beer in Belgium. This delicious lager is brewed with the finest ingredients (malt, maize, water, hop, yeast), using undisputed craftsmanship, ensuring an outstanding beer quality. Jupiler offers refreshment on a wide variety of occasions, thanks to its digestibility and accessible taste. Jupiler (5,2 % ABV) is ideally served at a temperature of 3°C. The low-alcoholic variant Jupiler N.A. (0.5%) should be served at 1-2°C.

Jupiler has an outspoken image of masculinity, courage and adventure. Furthermore, Jupiler understands men like no other brand and shares their best moments. This combination of male bonding, self-confidence and self-relativation, speaks to all men and makes Jupiler an ally on their road through life.

Jupiler is the official sponsor of the highest Belgian football division, the Jupiler League, and also supports the Belgian national football team. Just like football, Jupiler is all about competence and ruggedness, effort and effort reward, team spirit and... festivity!
