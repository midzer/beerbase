The rich mahogany hue of the Nut Brown is the first thing you will notice. You'll find subtle hints of both chocolate and coffee. We delicately blend chocolate and caramel malts with four others to make this flavorful, easy drinking beer. The malt character will appeal to those looking for a moderately dark ale, but the smoothness is what will surprise all.
