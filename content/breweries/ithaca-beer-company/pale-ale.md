Made with generous amounts of west coast hops, our Pale Ale boasts a fragrant aroma and a pleasant hop bite. It has a deep golden color, and nicely balances the bitterness of the hops with the sweetness of the malt. Whether you know hops or not, our Pale Ale will appeal to all those looking for a refreshing, well balanced ale.
