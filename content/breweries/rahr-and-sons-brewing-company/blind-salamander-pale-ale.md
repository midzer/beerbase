Blind Salamander Pale Ale is the first of a series of Rahr beers
called Rare Breed. These beers are dedicated to improving the lot of
endangered Texas species. Rahr is making donations from these proceeds
to the Texas Parks & Wildlife Foundation to help with the recovery
of these species. 

The Texas Blind Salamander is a rare cave dwelling troglobite amphibian native to San
Marcos, specifically the San Marcos Pool in the Edwards Aquifer. It has
bright red external gills for absorbing oxygen from the water. Its
mature length is 5 cm and its diet varies by what flows into its cave,
including shrimp, snails and amphipods. 

Blind Salamander Pale Ale is a blend of the finest pale malts and East Kent
Goldings hops. The fine balance of these toasted caramel malts and
earthy hops makes Blind Salamander an easy drinking and satisfying ale.
