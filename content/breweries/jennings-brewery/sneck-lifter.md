A dark beer with a reddish tinge derived from the use of coloured malts, full of complex flavours, which create an intriguing beer of great character.

In Northern English dialect sneck means door latch and a sneck lifter was a manâ€™s last sixpence which enabled him to lift the latch of a pub door and buy himself a pint, hoping to meet friends there who might treat him to one or two more.
