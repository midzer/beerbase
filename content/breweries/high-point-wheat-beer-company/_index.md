Founded in 1994, the High Point Brewing Company is the first exclusive wheat beer brewery in America. The founder and driving force of High Point is award-winning homebrewer, Greg Zaccardi. After working as a brewer in southern Germany, Greg returned to the US to open his brewery. His Ramstein beers are made with the same care and precision he learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used in Ramstein are all imported directly from Bavaria.
