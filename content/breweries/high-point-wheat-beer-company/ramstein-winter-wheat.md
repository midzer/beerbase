Also referred to as a Doppelbock, this is the strongest beer made by High Point. Rich creamy head with bouquet of wheat malt, black current, clove, and apple. Deep full flavors of caramel and chocolate malt balance with hops for a smooth warming character. The finish is smooth and malty leading to a subtle alcohol and dark caramel finish. The wonderful balance of this beer provides a complex profile that hides the 9.5% alcohol content. The perfect companion for a cold winter night.
