I have crafted this very special ale from the finest Challenger and Northdown hops, Maris Otter malted barley, and of course, our unique yeast, to create a truly extraordinary limited edition brew.

Individually packed and numbered, this bottle is one of only one hundred and forty-five thousand produced.
