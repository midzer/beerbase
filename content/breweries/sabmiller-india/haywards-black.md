Haywards Black, Indiaâ€™s first genuine stout beer , is handcrafted from a rich blend of the world famous Caledon valley dark roasted barley malt along with a blend of imported and locally produced pale malts. New Zealandâ€™s super alpha hops give Haywards Black a unique and pleasantly bitter taste with a hop like aroma. The Dark Roasted malt provides a rich dark colouring along with a unique smoky taste and aroma. The Slow brewing process which incorporates specially managed yeast creates the creamy head and the rich smooth taste that stout is so much loved for.
