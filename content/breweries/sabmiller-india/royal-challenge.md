Royal Challenge Premium Lager is the second largest selling mild beer in India. Royal Challenge is brewed with the choicest 6 malt barley. Its long brew duration provides it with a distinct, smooth taste and rich flavour. It has all the hall marks of a great beer - Color that is golden honey, taste that is smooth and crisp, lace that sticks to the wall of the glass. Royal Challenge Premium Lager is the beer for the discerning who have the confidence to make their choices based on their superior taste and knowledge rather than follow the crowd.
