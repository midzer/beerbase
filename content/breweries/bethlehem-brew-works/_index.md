Established on April 15, 1998 by the Fegley Family, Bethlehem Brew Works successfully captured the essence of Bethlehem's steel industry in a 250 seat brewpub. Signature beers include Steelworkers' Oatmeal Stout, Valley Golden ale, and the award winning Fegley's ESB. In addition, three seasonal taps have been frequented with beers ranging from Pale Ales and Wheats to Pumpkin Ale and Belgian Lambics. Accompanying the six beers brewed right in the restaurant is a full bar specializing in single malt scotches, small batch bourbons, and specialty martinis. Open seven days a week, BBW offers lunch and dinner featuring many items which incorporate the handcrafted beer into their recipes. Golden Ale Hummus, Beer and Cheese Soup, Brewschetta, Diamond Plate Pork, and Beer-Marinated Portabella Napoleon are just a hint of what the menu has to offer.
