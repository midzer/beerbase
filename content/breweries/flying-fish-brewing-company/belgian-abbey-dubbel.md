This Belgian-style Abbey Dubbel is an exceptionally complex beer with many interwoven flavors. This classic-style Abbey beer features an immense head with a fruity nose and a generous body. Malty in the middle, the beer features a clean, almondy dry finish and a slight alcohol warmth. More like a wine than a beerâ€”it has a lot of the qualities of a fine Burgundy.

Beer writer Michael Jackson has praised the Flying Fish Dubbel as a wonderful example of the style.""
