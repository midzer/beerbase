Traditional German-style, unfiltered wheat beer, with a lively balanced flavor. Although no fruit or spices were used in the brewing, these flavors are created by fermentation with special yeast from the oldest brewery in the world. Try Wild Frog Wheat with a slice of orange for a crisp, refreshing experience
