A rich, chocolaty English Porter with a clean finish. We use the finest floor-malted Maris Otter malts from England, the same malts used for the best single-malt scotch. A portion of malted rye gives a spicy, slightly dry finish.

Food Pairings: The rich, chocolate notes pair well with the carmelized surface of steaks, pork tenderloins and lamb, but save this beer for dessert if youâ€™re having chocolate or crÃ¨me brulÃ©e.
