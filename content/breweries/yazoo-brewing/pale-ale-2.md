A new version of an American classic. Our Yazoo Pale Ale bursts with spicy, citrusy hop aroma and flavor, coming from the newly discovered Amarillo hop. The wonderful hop aroma is balanced nicely with a toasty malt body, ending with a cleansing hop finish. Made with English Pale, Munich, Vienna, and Crystal malts, and generously hopped with Amarillo, Perle, and Cascade hops. Fermented with our English ale yeast.
