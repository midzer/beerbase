Introduced in 1989 Bud Dry is the first dry-brewed beer produced by an American brewer. It is brewed with select hops, grains and barley malt, which results in a lighter body and less-sweet taste. As with all Anheuser-Busch beers, it is cold-filtered for a smooth draft taste, but then goes through a second cold-filtered finishing process to provide its unique taste.
