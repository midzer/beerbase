Wild Blue is brewed with a blend of German hops from the Hallertau region in Bavaria and classic Aroma hops from the Willamette Valley in the Pacific Northwest. A combination of two- and six-row barley malt was also chosen specifically for this recipe. Beer lovers will also appreciate this specialty fruit-infused lager's striking burgundy color, ripe blueberry aroma and its ability to stand up to the strongest of foods.
