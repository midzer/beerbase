Sun Dog is an unfiltered beer, with a naturally cloudy appearance and fuller texture which allows it to stand up to spicy foods like Thai noodle salads and Cuban sandwiches.  The beer is best served in a tall, wide-mouthed glass which opens up the aromas of the beer and showcases its beautiful long-lasting head of white foam.
