Timmermans brews only traditional Lambic; the basic beer that, from spontaneous fermentation, is used throughout the entire range. Brewing Lambic, without adding yeast, is a complex and subtle art requiring recipes and patience passed on by the family. Lambics survive thanks to a handful of Brussels breweries and the presence of two micro-organisms that exist only in the Senne Valley: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis and Brettanomyces Lambicus. By adding fruit and spices, the magic of traditionallymade beers unravels: Strawberry, Kriek, PÃªche, Framboise, Forest Fruit, but also Oude Gueuze, Kriek Retro, Gueuze, Faro or Lambicus Blanche. A unique site: open daily (including weekends), booking required. Possibilities for your meetings and banquets.
