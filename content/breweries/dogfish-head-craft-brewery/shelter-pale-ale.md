This is our original brew and our most approachable beer. It's brewed with a premium barley and whole-leaf Glacial & Warrior hops. Our Shelter Pale Ale has a fine malt backbone and a slightly nutty flavor. A versatile, quaffable beer. The Shelter Pale Ale is available exclusively in the Mid-Atlantic region.
