9000 year old Chateau Jiahu stands apart as the most ancient, chemically-attested alcoholic beverage in the world. Its recreation is based on painstaking excavation by Chinese archaeologists of Jiahuin the Yellow River basin, state-of-the-art microanalysis of pottery residues by American laboratories, and the inspired \Neolithic\" brewing of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery.
