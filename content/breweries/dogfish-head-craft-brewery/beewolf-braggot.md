This is a hybrid of ale and mead made with 51% malted barley (Pale and Munich malted barley) and 49% Orange blossom honey, it is lightly hopped, spiced with Hibiscus flowers and fermented with Australian ale yeast.

Our Milton, DE microbrewery brewer Jon Talkington came up with this beer because of his love of different kinds of meads and his interest in Nordic lore and mythology.  The name Beewolf is the name Beowulf translated, meaning bear.
 
Color- light amber.
Aroma- Pear like fruitiness, with a clean malt and floral honey nose.
Flavor- sweet malt and honey with a subtle fruitiness and a hint of caramel.
ABV 7.0%
IBU's 25
