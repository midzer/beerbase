Launched in 2007, Miller Chill is the only light beer brewed with a hint of lime and a pinch of salt to provide a truly refreshing beer experience. Through all of our marketing efforts, beer drinkers will see that Miller Chill is a celebration and fusion of the best of two cultures, great light beer from America and the chelada style from Mexico. It's the new alternative in mainstream low-cal beers ... one that provides a crisper, smoother, more refreshing beer experience.
