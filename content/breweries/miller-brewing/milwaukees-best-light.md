Milwaukee's Best Light is Miller Brewing Company's lead low-calorie brand in the near-premium segment. Brewed to uncompromising standards using select pale malt, cereal grains and yeast, this is a smooth, highly drinkable beer at an affordable price. Available nationwide, Miller first rolled out Milwaukee's Best Light in 1986 with an ambition to become the beer choice for guys. Our marketing, including sponsorship with the World Series of Poker and award-winning TV spots, takes a humorous approach to reinforce the idea that Men should act like men and light beer should taste like beer.""
