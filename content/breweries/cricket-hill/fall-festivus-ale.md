Our Fall release is a harvest Ale with a lighter amber color and a beige head with good retention. There is a good balance of earthy malt and a blend of floral and pine hops in the nose. Biscuit notes mixing with caramel sweetness.do their job to complement the rest of the flavors.This is an enjoyable seasonal for sure!
