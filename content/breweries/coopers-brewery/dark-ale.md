A dark brew full of promise. Coopers Dark Ale is a journey in taste, starting fresh and creamy, and finishing with a lingering coffee flavour. 

Conditioned and naturally brewed using the top fermentation method, Coopers 'Dark' is made using roasted and chocolate malts, giving it a rich dark colour and unique flavour. 

Coopers Dark Ale has no additives and no preservatives.
