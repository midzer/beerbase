Birell has all the hallmarks of a great premium beer, rich colour, full malty flavour and the ability to quench a thirst, with one important difference - virtually no alcohol. 

Brewed under license in Australia by Coopers, Birell is made using only the finest Australian malted barley, hops and yeast, with no artificial additives or preservatives.

Coopers Birell may be found in most supermarkets (375ml bottles or cans).
