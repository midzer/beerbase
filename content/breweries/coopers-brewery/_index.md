Coopers Brewery produce a range of Ales,Stouts and Lagers.   Our ale range is brewed by a method of top fermentation, originating in the Middle Ages.  Coopers uses only natural ingredients including malt, hops, sugar, water and a special yeast strain that's over 90 years old.  Coopers do not use preservatives or chemicals in their ale range.   Coopers also produce Stout and Lager beers.  The Lager beers are bottom fermented in cooler conditions, matured for a short period and pasteurised.
