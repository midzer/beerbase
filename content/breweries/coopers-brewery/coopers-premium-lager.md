Coopers Premium Lager is quite different to the famous Coopers ales.  This lager produces a refreshing flavour with a good balance of malt and hop characters and is brewed using no sugar. With its subtle fruity esters and light golden colour, combined with a judicious blend of Pride of Ringwood and Saaz hops.  This produces a Lager with a crisp malty full flavour.
