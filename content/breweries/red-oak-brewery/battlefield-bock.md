Battlefield Bock is a smooth and creamy Bavarian Style Bock Lager. It is brewed with our proprietary blend of Bavarian Dark Roasted Malts giving it a distinct taste with hints of coffee and chocolate. We add Noble Czech Saaz Hops to balance the flavor of this rich full bodied lager.  Battlefield Bock is slow cold aged for a minimum of 8 weeks.
