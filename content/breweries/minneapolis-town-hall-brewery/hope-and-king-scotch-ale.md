Hope and King is a full-body brew and is rich in malt complexity. Brewed with both English and American barley and many, many specialty malts this deeply colored ale has hints of roasted chocolate, caramel and raisins with very little hop presence. Our interpretation of the classic ale that originated in Glasgow, Scotland.
