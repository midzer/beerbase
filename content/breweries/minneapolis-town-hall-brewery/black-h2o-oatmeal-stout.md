This is our darkest and most heavy regular offering. It is virtually black in color and features rich roasted malt flavor with a delicate caramel and vanilla finish. It is carbonated and served with the use of nitrogen gas, giving the Black Water a beautiful cascading pour and thick, creamy foam atop your glass. Made with only the freshest American malts and English hops.
