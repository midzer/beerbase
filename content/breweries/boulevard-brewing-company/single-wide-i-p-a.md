The latest addition to the Boulevard family of year-around beers, Single-Wide I.P.A. is our take on a style that originated in 18th century Great Britain. This American version -- inspired by our Smokestack Series Double-Wide I.P.A. -- boasts a heady combination of six varieties of hops, some of which were employed for dry-hopping.
