Boulevardâ€™s fall seasonal beer, Bobâ€™s â€™47 Oktoberfest is a medium-bodied, dark amber brew with a malty flavor and well-balanced hop character. With this Munich-style lager we solute our friend Bob Werkowitch, Master Brewer and 1947 graduate of the U.S. Brewerâ€˜s Academy. Available from September through October in bottles and on draught.
