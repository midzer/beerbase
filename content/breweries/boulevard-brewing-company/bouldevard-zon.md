Boulevard’s summer seasonal is our interpretation of a classic Belgian witbier. ZŌN (Flemish for “sun”) combines the subtle flavors of coriander and orange peel with other traditional ingredients to create a delightful, refreshing summertime brew. Available from May through August, in bottles and draught.
