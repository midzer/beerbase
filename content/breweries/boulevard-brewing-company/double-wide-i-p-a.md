Double-Wide I.P.A. uses Zeus and Magnum hops for both bittering and aroma, with Ahtanum hops added solely for aroma. Two additional dry hopping regimens employ Ahtanum, Centennial, and Chinook varietals. The resulting beer – not surprisingly – has a hop forward aroma, redolent of peach and apricot. The assertive flavor bursts forth with citrus notes of blood orange and lemon, a caramel malt backbone serves to balance the intensity of the hops. There is little restraint in the flavor of this beer; it is certainly not for the pedestrian palate.
