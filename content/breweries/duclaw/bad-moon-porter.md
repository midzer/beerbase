A complex, robust porter, Bad Moon is medium to full bodied with a slightly sweet, malty presence combined with hints of chocolate and coffee. This is a full-bodied beer that gets its chocolate and coffee-like flavors and color from the use of generous amounts of roasted malts. It has a smooth finish and a balanced hop character.
