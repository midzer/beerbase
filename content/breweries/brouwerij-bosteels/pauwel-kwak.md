LOOK:
Kwak is recognisable by its deep bright amber colour and a dense, creamy coloured head. The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.

SMELL:
You will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.

TASTE:
Discover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately.
