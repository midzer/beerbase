LOOK:
Tripel Karmeliet is a very refi ned and complex golden-to-bronze brew with a fantastic creamy head. These characteristics derive not only from the grains used but also from restrained hopping with Styrians and the fruity nature (banana and vanilla) of the house yeast.

SMELL:
Very refined and complex. Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.

TASTE:
Tripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine
dryness.
