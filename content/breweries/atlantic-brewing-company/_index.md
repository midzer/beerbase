The Atlantic Brewing Company began brewing in 1991, on the eve of the microbrewing revolution. We have steadily grown over the years by having a strong commitment to tradition, quality and service. As a result, we have become the number one beer of the Bar Harbor region.  In the spirit of old world tradition, our beers are sold and distributed by small independents (not national brands). Our beers are now available in select areas throughout the eastern US. We only brew 60 kegs per day, which allows us to still maintain our commitment to craftsmanship. The result is that our beers enjoy great respect in the beer community. Visit our Tasting Room for more information about our standard ales.  Our new facility was built on the site of an old farm a few miles from downtown Bar Harbor. It was designed to create a more visitor friendly environment similar to country wineries and breweries found throughout Europe.
