The word about the quality of our beer began to get around the metro New York region as soon as we turned on the spigots and started to serve it in our Southampton restaurant. Almost from day one, leading restaurants, pubs and taverns have requested our crafted brews for  their own patrons. Our Brewmaster, Phil Markowski  has personally directed the flow of our ales and lagers into the finest outlets. Our Mission is to offer a wide variety of specialty ales and lagers.  Our small batch brews range from classic farmhouse styles to traditional sessions beers to be enjoyed year-round.
