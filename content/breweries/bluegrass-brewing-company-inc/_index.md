The original Bluegrass Brewing Company opened in 1993 at this location, 3929 Shelbyville Road, near Westport Rd., & Chenoweth, & Breckenridge Lanes. It is the city's oldest remaining brewpub and was the first to make a significant mark on the national brewpub and microbrewery scene. Louisville's best beer is made at this location, and large glass windows in the back dining room allow you to witness the brewing operation. The headbrewer is Jerry Gnagy, assisted by Sam Cruz and Cody Mingus.
