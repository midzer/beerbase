According to legend, gold panned from the crystal clear Border streams of the Yarrow valley, nearby the site of the Broughton Ales brewery, was used to make the third wedding ring of Mary Queen of Scots.
 
This golden coloured ale is brewed with a skilful blend of organically grown hops and malt, and pure Scottish water to the exacting standards required by Soil Association Certification Ltd. of the United Kingdom.

The end result is a light golden coloured, clean tasting beer with an excellent hop aroma and aftertaste.

At 6.0% ABV a premium ale for those who know and care about what they eat and drink.

Border Gold has won several awards, the most recent being a bronze medal in the International Brewing Awards in Munich 2005.
