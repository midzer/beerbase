The Maibock style was traditionally produced in the winter and released in early May to celebrate the coming of Spring. This malty lager is deep golden in color and medium in body. The finish holds a bold sweetness that is balanced by a subtle hop flavor and aroma. 

We will be releasing this beer every spring in celebration of our Anniversary.
