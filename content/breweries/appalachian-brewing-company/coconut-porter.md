Based on the winning Homebrew Contest entry by John Slotterback and Fred Rogers, this dark, roasty porter is infused with fresh coconut which produces a sweet finish.  The coconut balances the chocolaty notes, producing a taste not unlike German chocolate cake in a glass! This will be brewed in Camp Hill and distributed in limited quantity to Harrisburg and Gettysburg.
