This IPA is an exciting beer with a floral in aroma and an incredible hop flavor. The maltiness is increased (over a regular pale ale) to help balance the aggressive hop usage. This contributes to the higher alcohol content as well. 
When India was part of the British Empire, pale ale shipped to the troops would often spoil due to the rough voyage and temperature extremes. The brewers had a theory that if they loaded the beer with extra hops, the hops would preserve the beer. Of course, this added significantly to the beerâ€™s flavor and aroma. When the troops returned to Britain, they had become \hop-heads\"
