Our Barley Wine is dark red in color and has an original gravity of 1.120 (24 Plato). The malt complexity of this classic ale style is incredible.

The Broad Street Market is located just blocks from the Appalachian Brewing Company. This indoor farmers market was built in 1863 and is one of the oldest continuously operating farmers markets in the United States. The beautiful brick faÃ§ade and natural wood doors are typical of the structures in Downtown Harrisburg; including our own building.
