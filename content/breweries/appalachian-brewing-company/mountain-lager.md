The Dortmunder-Export style of beer was developed in Westfalen, Germany, and is a classic light lager with great character. This style boasts a light golden blonde color and exhibits a moderate hop palate. The finish of our Mountain Lager is rich yet mellow.
Our brewers have developed this beer as a tribute to the Appalachian Mountains where we live and play.
