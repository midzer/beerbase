This Braggart Mead styled ale is light and refreshing with an essence of orange blossoms, pear, and honey in the aroma and a balanced fruity and clean finish. 

This style was developed by our Brewmaster to have the perfect carbonation and crispness on our summerâ€™s hot and humid Pennsylvania days.
