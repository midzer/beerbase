Trail Blaze Organic American Brown Ale exhibits a beautiful deep copper color and an evident hop bitterness & aroma.  This is balanced against roasted caramel-like characteristics and hints of chocolate. 

Our first in a series of organic beers is named for the markers that keep a hiker on the correct path.  Many of the hiking trails in our area have simple to very distinguished trail blazes.  After a long hike, there is nothing better at the end of the trail than ABC organic ale.
