This American wheat beer is infused with 20% wildflower honey resulting in a light, semi-sweet refreshing beverage.  This beer represents the next evolution of Sophieâ€™s Sparkling Ale as we have added the wheat base, essentially combining two of our most popular beers. This will be brewed in Camp Hill and distributed in limited quantity to Harrisburg and Gettysburg.
