The first in a series of two new specialty beers coming this year! This Kölsch-styled ale is clean, crisp, and delicately balanced. It has very subtle pear flavors and aromas. The subdued maltiness leads to a pleasantly refreshing finish. A fantastic summer brew!

The Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), is one of the best-known architectural monuments in Germany and has been Cologne's most famous landmark since its completion in the late 19th century. True Kölsch can only be brewed if the brewery has a view of this famous cathedral, thus its’ appearance on our tap markers.
