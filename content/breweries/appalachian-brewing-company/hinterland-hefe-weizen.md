A special German wheat ale yeast produces clove and banana flavors during fermentation leaving this unfiltered beer with an incredibly spicy and fruity complexity!

Our Brewmaster has acquired many medals at the Great American Beer Festival for this beer style. A difficult, four-step infusion mash schedule produces the complexity of this traditional beer style.
