Monteith’s Celtic Beer is considered an ‘Irish-style ale’ in the heritage of beers of a burnt-red colour traditionally brewed in the Emerald Isle.

Monteith’s Celtic Beer has a dry roasted malt flavour characteristic of this style of brewing. This malty characteristic and crisp dryness is derived from malts of the roasted chocolate malt style. The hop character is medium to allow the chocolate malts to show through.

Monteith’s brewers have been able to develop traditional ale fermentation characters while allowing the interesting roasted malt notes to come through in the aroma.
