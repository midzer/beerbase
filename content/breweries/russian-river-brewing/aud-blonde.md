Aud Blonde has a refined characteristic, which can be contributed to us blending pilsner malt with a unique hop called crystal. The distinctive characteristic of the crystal hop lends a citrus, almost eucalyptus quality in the aroma and mouth feel of the brew, while leaving the beer with a long dry finish.
