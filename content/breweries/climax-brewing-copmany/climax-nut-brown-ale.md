This style of beer is based on the English Mild, which was a combination of a stout and a lighter beer favored by coal miners in Scotland, Ireland and North England.
We've brought together the grains used to make both a Stout and a Pale Ale and balanced them in our Nut Brown Ale to produce a beer with a chocolate and molasses flavor and hints of caramel and coffee in the background.
