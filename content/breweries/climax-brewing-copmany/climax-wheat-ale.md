Hoffmann Hefeweizen is our newest offering and is a traditional German wheat beer made from 60% wheat malt and 40% barley malt. Wheat Ales such as this typically have banana and clove flavors but as Dave dislikes clove, he used a special yeast to strengthen the banana flavors. Hefeweizen is a nice, light, crisp summer beer that can be served with lemon or flavored syrups.
