Brewed for our 10th Anniversary, the Barleywine is a bottle conditioned ale that's meant to be laid down and enjoyed for years to come. Up front it has a hop nose and hop flavor on the tongue that fades into malty overtones with flavors of vanilla that go into chocolate. As it has aged, we've noticed flavors of dates and raisins as well.
