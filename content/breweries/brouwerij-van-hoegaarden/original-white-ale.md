Hoegaarden, both unique and very refreshing, is an authentic Belgian wheat beer. In fact, it is the original â€œWitâ€� beer! First brewed in 1445, this top-fermented beer is refermented in the bottle or keg. Hoegaarden has a distinctive, cloudy yellow colour and a uniquely refined taste that balances a slight spiciness from a touch of coriander and orange peel.
