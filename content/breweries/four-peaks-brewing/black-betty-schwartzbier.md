This almost black lager originates from Germany and is most closely associated with Porter. The difference being the long maturation period (or lagering time) required to produce a true Schwartzbier. The flavor is reminiscent of treacle, coffee and toasted malt. It is not and should not be perceived as burnt or ashy like some stouts. Black Betty has 5% alc/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.

The name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940â€™s which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others.
