Leroy's BIG Brother. Sweet floral hop aroma balances out the big malty roasted body with the slightest bitter spiced-chocolate finish. A very untraditional hopping technique gives this beer a unique character significantly more robust than our traditional Leroy Brown Ale. The beer weighs in at 5.0% alc./vol. Cheers!!
