Our Oatmeal Stout is definitely a local favorite but it gets its origins from one of London's oldest breweries. The Oatmeal Stout differs from the popular Irish stout in its more subtle roastiness and subdued dryness. The addition of flaked oats rounds out these sometimes harsh characteristics producing a velvet smooth ale. This black stout has a flavor profile unique to all of North America. Subtlety is not a strong point as it is a stout after all, rich and eminently drinkable. 

Alcohol content of approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)
