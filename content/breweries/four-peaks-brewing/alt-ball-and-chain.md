This beer was brewed in honor of our brewer Melissa's wedding to fellow brewer Derek Osbourne of B.J.'s in Chandler. The Alt Ball and Chain is a German Altbier. These beers are generally full-bodied with sweet malt flavor. The crispness, dry finish, and moderate hop aroma make an alt a great beer for summertime enjoyment. Our Alt has been lagering in our cellar for two weeks and contains 5.2% abv.
