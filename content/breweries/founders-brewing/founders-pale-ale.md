A testament to Cascade hops in a bottle. Our medium-bodied, Pale Ale has a distinctive floral hop aroma and refreshing citrus flavor. Founders Pale Ale has a slight malty sweetness with a balanced hop finish. A perfect beer to enjoy while mowing the lawn, boating, grilling with friends or just taking it easy.
