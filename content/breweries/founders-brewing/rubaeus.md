As promised Founders Brewing Company has created something unlike the rest. Amongst this summers over croweded race to cloudy wheat beers, we have decided to embark down a path all our own. Using only fresh rasberries, rubaeus translates into intese flavors combined with a no hesitation malt bill. In fermentation we add fresh rasberries at five separate stages to achieve the ulttimate balance between tartness and sweetness.
