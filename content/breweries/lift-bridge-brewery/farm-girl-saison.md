This pale golden, Belgian-influenced ale is for everyone: Farm Girl, wannabe Farm Girl. In the Belgian Farmhouse tradition, this brew has a dry malt finish and a spiciness that only Belgian yeasts can create. Smooth and well rounded... this one can please anyone in any situation, whether you are on the water, in the sun, or hiding from winter's chill.
