How about trying a glass of traditional Irish stout. Our stout however is not particularly dry and has overtones of dark chocolate and toffee. The infused nitrogen gives a wonderful cascading effect in the glass and a rich, creamy head. Particularly tasty when paired with our oysters on the half shell.
