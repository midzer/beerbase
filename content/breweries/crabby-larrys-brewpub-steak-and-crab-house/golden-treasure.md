For those who enjoy a clean, crisp, refreshing beer this medium copper colored brew is perfect. With its low level of hop bitterness and slightly sweet flavor it is one of our lightest ales. We use the lightest grains with Kent Goldings and Liberty hops. This beer is an excellent choice for the not so brave.
