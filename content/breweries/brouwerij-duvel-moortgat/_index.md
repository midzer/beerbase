oday, the Duvel Moortgat group, founded in 1871, is an independent producer of authentic speciality beers and premium brands. Around the world, the group is considered to be the leading producer of blond, bottle conditioned, high fermentation beers, a dominant position owed largely to the success of its best-selling product Duvel. A niche player, Duvel Moortgat occupies a leading position in the strategic segments of speciality beers and premium brands like Duvel, Maredsous, Bel Pils and Vedett. The group markets Steendonk white beer in a joint venture with the Palm brewery. Duvel Moortgat has also entered the market of natural fruit juices with a 70% participation in the quality juice producer Freya. Today, the group's beers are exported to over 40 countries. Duvel Moortgat has also taken a firm foothold in Central Europe, thanks to a 50% participation in the Czech Bernard brewery, renowned for its premium Pilsners. The group has launched itself into the market of artisan premium beers through the acquisition of the American Ommegang brewery. Duvel Moortgat has also been listed on the Brussels Euronext stock exchange since 1999.
