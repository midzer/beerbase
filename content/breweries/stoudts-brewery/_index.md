Over 20 years, Stoudt's Brewing Company has grown and evolved from a small brewery with limited draught distribution, to a packaging regional microbrewery with distribution in 10 different states, producing over 10,000 barrels a year. Even with the growth over the years, one thing has always remained constant, and that is the attention to detail that goes into every batch of handcrafted beer that is traditionally brewed, packaged and sold with passion by our small team of hardworking dedicated employees. A tradition that was started by Ed and Carol and will be carried on by their children for many years to come
