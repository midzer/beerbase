Our Big A IPA has earned its share of praise over the last few years. In 2004 the New York Times named it its top IPA , and in 2007 Mens Journal Magazine included it on its list of 25 best beers in America. The last of each year's edition typically leaves our warehouse around mid-May, and, as always, it doesn't last long. 

Stash Wojciechowski, the “Killer Kielbasa,” created this bonafide India Pale Ale recipe exclusively for the Smuttynose Big Beer Series.
