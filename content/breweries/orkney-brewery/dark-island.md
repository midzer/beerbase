Dark Island is an iconic beer: a standard-bearer for traditional Scottish ales. In cask, this beer has twice won CAMRAâ€™s Champion Beer of Scotland.
On the nose, this dark beer offers bitter chocolate, figs, toffee and hints of fruit.

On the palate, this resolves into beautiful, silky-smooth, coffee-and-chocolate flavours, followed by figs, dates and dried fruits, with a very appealing, lingering aftertaste of fruits and hop bitterness.
