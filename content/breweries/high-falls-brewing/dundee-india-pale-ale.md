It takes a bit of seasoning to understand that bitter can be a good thing. 

When youâ€™re a child, you want everything to be sweet. When youâ€™re a teenager, you want everything to be sweeeeet. But when you get a bit wiser and acquire some taste, you realize that bitter is an excellent alternative. Itâ€™s a sign of complexity. Itâ€™s a sign of maturity. Itâ€™s a sign of the times. Face it, modern life demands a little bitterness every once in a while. 

When you are in the mood for something bitter, Dundee IPA is hop bitterness at its finest. As the youngsters would say, thatâ€™s sweet.

An aggressively hopped IPA brewed with Amarillo and Simcoe hops. Blended Crystal malts balance the flavors with a distinctive spicy aroma and a long, crisp finish.
