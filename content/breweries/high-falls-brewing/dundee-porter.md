More and more weâ€™re becoming a nation of milquetoasts. And nowhere is that more evident than in our beerâ€”puny liquids without calories, carbs, or cojones. 

But it neednâ€™t be that way, my friend! Sure, we donâ€™t want to make a living shoveling coal or washing clothes on a rock. But we can recapture the more robust spirit of a time gone by.

Dundee Porter is a throwback to a different eraâ€”when times were tough and so were the people. They drank big beers, slapped each other on the back, and toasted the good lifeâ€”even though they only saw it from a distance. 

With Dundee Porter, you can get a taste of it.

Big and malty flavor from aromatic dark-roasted grains balanced by a subtle hint of hops. Deep color and rich caramel flavor.
