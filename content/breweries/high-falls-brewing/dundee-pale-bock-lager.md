Certain things seem interminable. The line at the DMV. The commencement address. Winter. 

But take heart. Even the longest, darkest winter gives way to spring and a new sense of optimism that the best is just ahead. That thoughtâ€”and an itchy wool robeâ€”sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. 

So when youâ€™re stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.

A traditional German Maibock with a deep, golden color, malty-sweet aroma, and clean finish from Magnum and Czech Saaz hops.
