The Wedge Brewing Co. is located in the lower level of the Wedge Studios situated in the River Arts District of Asheville, N.C. The building is a classic brick warehouse adjacent  to the railroad tracks. The original use of the structure was probably as a food warehouse. The space the brewery is in at onetime stored slaughtered hogs.
    We chose this location because it is in the last frontier of Asheville.
    We chose this specific space because it is a perfect fit for our brewing system and gives
us great outdoor potential.
