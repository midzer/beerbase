By George, I think we've got it.

Days of debate and deliberation at Independence Hall were often followed by nights of debate and deliberation (and a few libations) at the City Tavern, where our forefathers would gather to exchange revolutionary ideas.

Rich and warming with a deep garnet hue, the molasses-based Tavern Porterâ„¢ reflects Washington's admiration of Philadelphia-style porters and follows a recipe Washington used himself, when brewing beer to satisfy his thirsty field officers.

Enjoy a taste of history, courtesy of Yards Brewing Company, Philadelphia's premier brewer and bottler.

Historical note: Our new brewery is located just blocks away from the site of Robert Hair's brewery, where Washington's favorite Philadelphia Porter was crafted.
