Not to be boastful, but we honestly believe that all other ales pale in comparison to this one. Brewed with pilsner malt, Philadelphia Pale Ale is crisp and hoppy, bursting with citrus flavors and aromas.

Philadelphia Pale Ale was named one of the best Pale Ales in the country by the New York Times.
