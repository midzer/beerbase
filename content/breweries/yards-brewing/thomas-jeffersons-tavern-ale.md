All beers are not created equal.

While Thomas Jefferson spent much of his time in Philadelphia drafting, editing, revising, and re-editing the Declaration of Independence, he longed to be home in Monticello, where twice a year his wife Martha would brew up one of his favorite beverages â€” beer.

Thomas Jefferson Tavern Aleâ„¢ is a strong golden ale, based on Jefferson's original recipe, which included ingredients specified and grown on his Virginia estate.
