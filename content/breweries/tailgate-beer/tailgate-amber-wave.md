Why put everything in a category? Live outside the box. The â€˜flagshipâ€™ of TailGate Beer, Amber Wave, is a completely unique and individual beer that raises the standards and breaks all the molds.

Amber Wave was inspired by America's amber waves of grain and is as unique as apple pie.  The intellectuals behind TailGate Beer created this dark, rose colored ale that drinks like honey and lingers of light caramel, with notes of chocolate and sweet subtle hops. Surprise yourself, and others, with your sophisticated palate and acute ability to find the best beer brewed for drinking, not sampling.
