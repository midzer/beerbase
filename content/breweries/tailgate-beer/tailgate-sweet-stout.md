Don’t be afraid of the dark. This Sweet Stout is a surprisingly charming, and yet extremely robust ale that spills a soothing bouquet of caramel, chocolate and lightly roasted oats.  As a truly unique foray into the world of stout ales, this sweet stout drinks so light you might be surprised at how apt you are to enjoy the darkest of TailGate Beer’s. The flavors are so rich and smooth that this TGB Sweet Stout can cool you on the hottest of days and warm you in the worst that winter can bring. Here is heaven in a bottle. If it weren't so wrong, this is what you wish mom could have given you in your baby bottle.  Treat yourself right and enjoy an experience that is the best dessert to pass through your lips since mom last made her best fruit pie for you.
