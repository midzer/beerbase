TailGate Beer does the German style wheat beer right. Hints of citrus, complemented by sprinkles of spice that makes a German, full flavored brew that is really hard to say right.  Proud of the names ‘weizen’ (wheat) base ingredient, TGB draws most of its flavor from the famed grass plant. This Hef is one truly crisp, and refreshing unfiltered ale that garnishes well with a lemon or an orange!   Be sure to impress your friends with your fine tuned palate and sophisticated verbiage next time you belly up to order your TailGate Beer “HEH-feh-vite-zehn”
