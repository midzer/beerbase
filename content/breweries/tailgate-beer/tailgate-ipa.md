This is what beer is all about.  First swallow offers a nice little bite, followed by a blossom of flavors delivered by our handpicked aromatic hops.  Flavor carries through the end with a full fisted kick of alcohol content that rocks the Richter scale at 6.5%.  A nose of citrus with a floral essence of spice tickles the tongue in this ode to hops.  Discover an IPA that encourages how to enjoy what beer is all about.
