This is your solution to the same ol' ho hum brown ale you drink all the time. This ale might be dark and intimidating in a glass, yet the first sip proves to be a surprisingly refreshing assault on your taste buds. Complex blends of chocolate and roasted oats complement the essence of bittering hops, and sweet malts.  The balanced combination makes this full flavored ale one to be enjoyed in any occasion.
