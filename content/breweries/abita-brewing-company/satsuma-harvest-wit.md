Real Louisiana Satsumas, golden wheat, oats and the finest barley create Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit. Pale and cloudy, like the haze on a hot summer day, this white beer has a sweet and subtle citrus flavor with a touch of spice that is cool and refreshing. 

Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit is very versatile and can compliment a number of dishes. This brew pairs well with salads, fish, shrimp and lobster, as long as the dishes are not too spicy. Thai dishes, which often have citric notes in their flavor profile, would also perfectly compliment the orange flavors in Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit.
