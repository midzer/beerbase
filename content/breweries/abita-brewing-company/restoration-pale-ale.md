Abita Restoration Pale Ale was created after the back-to-back hurricanes devastated Louisiana. With your help, the abita Brewing Company raised over $500,000 for hurricane relief. This brilliant, golden pale ale has a rich body, mild bitterness and a snappy, fresh citrus hop flavor and aroma. Cold filtered and brewed in small batches using no additives or preservatives, the Abita Company is proud to be Louisiana True.
