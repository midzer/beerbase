This is a smooth, full flavoured, truly dark mild with a rich creamy head. It has a full body and distinctive roasted malt taste, balanced by its fresh hop character. Complex flavours and aromas are achieved by blending deeply roasted malt and adding a selected blend of English hops, including dry hops, to the cask conditioned beer.
