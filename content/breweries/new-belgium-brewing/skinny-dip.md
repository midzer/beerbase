Ever tried a Skinny Dip? You wouldn't be alone. Featured by both Men's Journal and the Today Show as a favorite summer brew, this full-bodied, highly drinkable beer makes a splash every summer in our Seasonal line-up. Cascade hops frolic with a hint of lime leaf, giving the beer complexity that's surprisingly refreshing.
