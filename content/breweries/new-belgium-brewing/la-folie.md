La Folie Wood-Aged Biere, is our original wood-conditioned beer, resting in French Oak barrels between one and three years before being bottled. . Peter Bouckaert, came to us from Rodenbach â€“ home of the fabled sour red. Our La Folie emulates the spontaneous fermentation beers of Peterâ€™s beloved Flanders with sour apple notes, a dry effervescence, and earthy undertones. New in 2010, we'll do a single bottling of La Folie for the year. Collect the 22oz unique to 2010 designed bottle and start a yearly wood-aged collection of goodness.
