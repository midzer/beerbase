Pull on your wool socks and crack open a 2Â° Below Ale. This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill â€“ a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800â€™s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2Â° Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow.
