Scape Goat is our award-winning Pale Ale. It is a very smooth brew, refreshing and well-balanced. Scape Goat took home the Gold Medal from the North American Brewers' Association competitions as the best English-style pale ale brewed west of the Mississippi, but only because it is the best. Scape Goat is brewed with pale, crystal malts, and Kent Goldings and Crystal Hops. Scape Goat is 3.8% alcohol by weight and 4.7% by volume.
