From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Creamy, malty, and full-bodied, the Sierra Nevada Stout is satisfyingly rich. Caramel and Black malts give the Stout its deep, dark color and pronounced roasted flavor. 

â€œSierra Nevada Stout is admirable from nose to finish, with notes of malty sweetness to the palate but plenty of bitterness available to set up a stimulating counterpoint.â€
