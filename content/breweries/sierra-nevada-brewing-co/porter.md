From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Dark and rich, Sierra Nevada Porter is a delicious, medium-bodied ale with a creamy head. The Porterâ€™s smooth flavor (malty with hints of caramel) comes from a blend of deep-roasted barley malts.


â€œâ€¦there can be little doubt that this is one of the best porters being brewed anywhere in the world today.â€�
