From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Dark and rich, Sierra Nevada Porter is a delicious, medium-bodied ale with a creamy head. The Porter’s smooth flavor (malty with hints of caramel) comes from a blend of deep-roasted barley malts.


“…there can be little doubt that this is one of the best porters being brewed anywhere in the world today.”

— Christopher Finch, A Connoisseur’s Guide 
to the World’s Best Beer
