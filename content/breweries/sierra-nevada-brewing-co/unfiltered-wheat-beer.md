From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Pale, smooth, and light-bodied, Sierra Nevada Wheat Beer is brewed from premium malted wheat and light barley malts, utilizing our traditional ale yeast. This unfiltered ale is finished with the characteristically spicy Strissel Spalt hops from the Alsace region of France. 

â€œThe lightest Sierra Nevada beer is this refreshing wheat beer made with barley & wheat for a very light character but loads of flavor!â€�
