From the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. website:
Our Summerfest® is a refreshing, pilsner-style lager. Its incredible smoothness comes from an extra-long lagering period. Lighter in body than our ales but just as complex in character, Summerfest® quenches your thirst with big aroma and a tangy hop bite. 

GOLD MEDAL WINNER
California State Fair (European Light Lagers: 1999)
