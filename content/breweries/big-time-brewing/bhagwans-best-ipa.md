Building on a classic English style and adding some uniquely Northwest touches, Bhagwan's Best has developed fiercely loyal following wherever it is served.  Bursting with local hop flavor, bitterness, and aroma, it is a particular treat when served dry-hopped and cask-conditioned on Big Time's beer engine. O.G. 16 Plato (1.064), alcohol is approximately 5% by weight.
