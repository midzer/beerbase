Big Time's brewery is a 14 barrel JV Northwest system consisting of a gas fired brew kettle, an infusion mash tun with mixer, a hot liquor back, a wort cooler, (5) 14 barrel fermenters, a diatomaceous earth filter, a bright beer tank, and (12) 7 bbl serving tanks.  We sell most of our beer at the pub but do wholesale a limited number of kegs to a few Seattle area taverns. We currently brew approximately 1,500 barrels of beer per year
