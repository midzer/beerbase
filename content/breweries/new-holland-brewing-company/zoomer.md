A refreshing wheat ale, Zoomer is brewed to quench your summer thirst. American-grown wheat provides Zoomer's straw color and its soft, clean body. With subtle, yet flavorful hints of citrus fruit in its finish, Zoomer is the perfect companion to all things summer. Food pairings include artisan cheeses, fresh greens, fish and chicken.
