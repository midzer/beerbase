Golden in color with a slightly sweet body. Its ester-laden character reveals an enigmatic dance between Belgian ale yeast and candy sugar complimented by a pleasing dry finish. Black Tulip is a versatile beer for food. Enjoyable pairings include mild bleu cheeses, berries and other light desserts.
